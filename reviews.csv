This game is very nice to look at, the art style is very cute, and the music is enjoyable as well. The gameplay has a bit of a learning curve but once you figure it out it is definitely a game that can be as fun as slay the spire.

These are main differences between slay the spire(I have over 300 hours played) some I like some I dont..

Positives:

+Like slay the spire there are 3 distinct areas, as well as fourth secret area that serves as 'true ending' if you are able to get the prerequisites. 

+There are no 'hallway fights', each of the three areas you fight a mini boss, as well as a big boss. The battles include having you fight some waves of minions before the boss shows up, which kind of serves as 'hallway fights' but its all one fluid battle for each boss/mini boss.  I prefer this because I easily get exhausted of the hallway fights in slay the spire.

+The events in each area are all positive and are pretty fun; you get to pick a card, go to a shop, get a new companion, etc.  I find this much more enjoyable than slay the spires negative events.

+There are two lanes on a grid, where you can summon companions to fight with your hero; this makes positioning important and adds another layer of fun/depth to the game.

+Beautiful menus, and the main menu is a lovely snowy town that serves as your home base, where you can 
see what tasks you need to in a run to unlock more cards, I find this a lot more fun then the unlocking process in slay the spire.

+The game is plenty difficult and I think if you play with every storm skull on its at least as difficult as ascension 20, perhaps more.

Negatives:

-While the three tribes you can play are distinct the difference in them is not as large as the differences between the classes in slay the spire.  So runs are made more distinct by the mix of characters you use rather than the tribe you pick.  

-You dont really make huge decks like you can in slay the spire, which is not a big problem as there is plenty to do each turn but there is rarely a moment where you feel desperate to draw something because in general its easy to keep your deck small and good. 

All in all I reccomend this game if you like slay the spire.","0","1730171778","true","604","702","692","2","0","0","0","0"

10/10 would recommend.  Especially if there is a sale.  There is a mobile version, which is a bit cheaper.  Mobile version is good, but the mods in the Steam Workshop make the extra few bucks worth it.  There are some great DLCs that feel like campaign expansions (and some that sometimes crash your game).

There are a ton of great mods to be found in the Workshop, which has really extended the life of this game.","0","1730138167","true","15336","15823","1200","2","0","0","0","0"

It offers just the right amount of complexity to make every run unique while also being simple enough to master. There is a large learning curve and the game gets very difficult, however the difficulty progression is done really well and at no point did I ever rage quit or feel like the game was too hard. The game is very well balanced and it is possible to get good enough to win every run on the hardest difficulty regardless of luck. Each run takes approx. 1-1.5 hrs for me to complete (although it may be less for most people because I am autistic), making it a great game to play during breaks such as a free period at college. The game took me approx. 60 hrs to get all the achievements in, however there are some optional challenges not in the steam achievements. I am enjoying getting 100% in the game because it has not felt as grindy as similar games such as balatro. The modding scene in this game is also massive, although I can't say much about them other than the fact that it is extremely easy to mod (if I can do it, so can you) because I am yet to go that in depth into them. Overall, this game is phenomenal and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys roughlikes, card games, or basically any strategy game at all.","0","1729987710","true","10070","10071","780","3","0","0","0","0"

Wildfrost is a well executed roguelike deckbuilder with an engaging gameplay loop, clean and cute designs, interesting core mechanics, and a variety of valid strategies. As many others have already stated, the game is difficult but definitely not unbeatable or (imo) unbalanced. The game requires careful consideration and planning during battles which might mean taking a few minutes per turn every now and again. From my personal experience, most of my runs have ended owing to faulty decision on my end rather than unbeatable enemy encounters. It is not only vital to collect cards that synergize but also to have answers for various enemy types and situations in your deck. 

Overall, if you have played and enjoyed similar games, I can wholeheartedly recommend Wildfrost and I truly hope that the unwarranted percentage of negative reviews does not rob the game of the attention it deserves.","0.681679725646972656","1681587867","true","1392","1392","0","2","199","44","0","0"

Missing features like quitting a run if you're not having a good time with a current build.

Each run has you deciding between 3 clans, each of which have access to unique cards. Clans are varied enough to feel distinct and complex enough to encourage multiple play styles.

Between battles the navigation will branch off allowing you to decide whether you want to add, upgrade, remove or even duplicate cards. Not all cards are applicable to every situation, but all are viable depending on how well they pair with upgrades, party members and items.

Difficulty is surprisingly granular. Rather than a slider that makes enemies stronger, you are given a list of modifiers that change the mechanics of the game. On their own these changes won’t impact your experience much but when stacked will make you rethink each enemy encounter and card pick up.","0","1729136202","true","3997","3997","0","2","318","0","0","0"

While there are some issues that begin to rear their head once you get into the high level gameplay, for the average player I'd say it's a fun, if challenging, game that is definitely worth the price.

In Wildfrost, you play as any number of adventurers seeking to end the sudden eternal blizzard the world was plunged into. You recruit new companions and obtain new cards to build a synergy strong enough to take down the frost spirit that has ruined the world with unending winter. I'd say the gameplay is fairly reminiscent of Slay the Spire, but it puts enough unique spins on it to be its own thing that I honestly don't think is like anything else on the market, so I'll assume you've played most deckbuilding roguelikes and get down to the unique parts of this game.

Unlike in most deck battlers, there is no cost system whatsoever. Instead, every card has a cooldown (or conditional activation) that advances once a turn, and a turn is consumed by playing a card- that's it. Thus there are no 'expensive' or 'cheap' cards, the only limit is how much time you have to play everything. When the cooldown timer for a card reaches 0, it activates its attack or other special effects. This results in interesting situations where you can't play everything you want and you have to decide which is more important- where to cut your losses, and who to sacrifice. This is the meat and potatoes of this game and it's a lot of fun! It also means synergies are a lot more freeing than they are in other games of this genre, as there are no cards locked away behind high costs and the like.

The game also has a unique positioning system: there are two 'rows' and 3 slots for each row, for a total of 6 slots- this is the same for the enemy side as well. Normally only the units in the front of each row can be hit, but special keywords can help you reach the back lines, and the same is true of the enemies. Choosing where to position your units is almost half of the challenge, and messing it up can be the difference between life and death in a lot of cases. Combined with the previously mentioned cooldown system and you have a game that's got a lot more strategic depth than meets the eye.

The game has 3 tribes- one is available by default, the other two you unlock through playing the game (along with a host of other companions and cards), and all of them play dramatically differently. To roughly summarize: there's the Snowdweller faction which focuses on various status effects, the Shadowmancer faction which focuses on summoning and sacrificing tokens, and the Clunkmaster faction which revolves around the production and use of 'junk' cards in exchange for having powerful effects. There's more than one archetype for each faction and even some cross-archetype support cards, meaning there's quite a few deck types you can make.

These are all elements that make this game fairly unique and I think their excellent execution, along with the overall polish the game has, are what help it stand out from a relatively bloated genre as something special. That being said, it's not without its problems. I'll introduce some issues I encountered with the game in no particular order:

- This game suffers from the 'Balatro effect' where the lower difficulties are fun and everything is viable, but as you get to the higher challenge levels, the amount of viable builds takes quite a bit of a hit and some cards are just straight up better than others. Unlike Balatro there's a lot of strategy with card positioning and support cards meaning that to some extent you can still win with a 'bad' deck with enough skill, but it still remains an issue.

- Every deck has a 'leader' card that must be on the field at all times, and if that leader dies at any point you instantly lose the run. This can be very fun and lead to some tense situations, but at the same time it also means that if you mess up, your leader can be oneshot and instantly kill your attempt. Combined with the fact that this game has a lot of oblique interactions, and you can often find yourself playing your card and then dying without realizing how for a good few moments. This would be fine if the runs weren't so long- you might speed up as you get better at the game, but even after ~30 hours it still takes 1-2 hours to win a run for me. Imagine suddenly losing 45 minutes of progress to a dumb mistake, and that's something that will forever be a threat no matter how good you get. This may vary for different players, but for me it can be rather disheartening.

- Wildfrost has a 'charm' system where you can get little charms to put on cards during runs to empower them. The system itself is very clever and fun, but I personally take issue with the meta-progression system used to unlock them- essentially you unlock charms by completing achievements. Some you will unlock over the course of playing the game and others are fun challenges, but there are a few that are extremely luck-based or require getting a certain build online, which given the random nature of what is given to you, may take several hours to even get a chance at completing. I would like to see some of these requirements changed, especially the 'get a 6x combo to unlock the last pet' one, because locking gameplay behind luck-based achievements kind of sucks.

While it's got some rough edges, I think there's more than enough fun to be had here to offset that, and with daily runs and hardcore challenge modes available, there's enough here to last you potentially hundreds of hours, if you so desire. The game occasionally goes for sale, but I think it's plenty worth it to buy even at full price!","0.579288065433502197","1728763944","true","1988","1988","0","53","396","5","0","0"

1. to many enemies that you can't even out dps with your party,
2. not have enough health to compete with the dps you receive 
3. not get a strong deck built up to compete with some of the harder boss fights 
4. get bad roles with items and other things. 

i've had runs where i just give up because i don't stand a chance against the enemies as one of said things above have happened 

This game is great but i feel like they need to tone down some of the fights from being win or lose to something that you can come back from

There were too many cards/charms with such specific use cases as to be nearly impossible to use correctly outside of an incredibly lucky run, very few defensive options in the early game with no guarantee to get more, and the best strategy that I was able to find involved ignoring most of the boss upgrades in favour of just having more field presence; It was either laughably easy, or frustratingly impossible, depending on your luck.

It was also really short, considering just how few cards there were to unlock. Since last year, the game's gotten a few updates with all new cards (as expected), but they also came with sweeping changes to the game's overall flow from beginning to end, smoothing out the curve of your progress so that you can now realistically prepare for oncoming nonsense with more generalist strategies, rather than having to bank on a specific gameplan just to survive.

It needed a little longer in the oven (or the freezer, I suppose) and now that it's had the time, the things that are unique about it can really shine through. Having minor upgrades that can be applied to most cards allow the player to experiment with different builds on the fly, choosing between buffing the stable cards until they're meta-defining bombs that carry you, and buffing your own specialist setups to completely break the game's balance and trounce all the bosses in seconds. Amusingly, the more broken your build, the harder your next run is likely to be, and having to plan around your own previous strategy is so diabolical a wrench that I sincerely hope other roguelites start finding ways to sprinkle it in.

Also it has workshop support now, so I'm obligated to recommend it.","0","1681856650","true","2532","3243","130","59","0","0","0","0"

It tries to waste time of player in nearly every way possible. I know devs promised to relook balance and such, but I don't think they would solve existential problems which this game got - after all, they had a lot of time for balancing, they spent a lot of time and money for promotion, they tried their best to make graphics and sound design as alluring as possible - but they didn't bother to change simpliest things.

1. You have meta progression which gives you more options for cards. Giving more options in deckbuilding roguelike means making pool of cards bigger, which makes getting card you need right now much less likely. Same could be said about charms and trinkets. As you progress further, you just shoot yourself in a leg. This is bad design.
2. Some options for map events are locked behind upgrades. I didn't believe at first, but yeah - if you want to have variety in your runs, you need to go for specific achievements. And it seems you can't turn these new options off. Meaning, this is also way to shoot yourself into leg and get rarely helpful events instead of much needed card draft.
3. Biggest crime is having unlocks being limited to one per type. Each unlock also needs to play specific build instead of playing as you like. It means game does not want you to play - it wants you to farm. Farm in specific way devs decided. I haven't unlocked second pet for ten runs or so because I didn't NEED 'Demonized' effect. I wanted to play with other effects. This problem could be easily solved by allowing player to get new stuff by unlocking any achievement at any time, not in specific order - otherwise it feels like some sort of battle pass. But would devs do that? I doubt.
4. Starting with random hero means sometimes you must to pick between three useless heroes because balance is weird and random is huge. Some heroes have little synergy with starting cards you get for their Tribe, but before you could get cards you need you could be swarmed and killed by enemy, even in first battle if you aren't lucky enough.
5. Enemies are having too much fun. Some of them are literal BS. They enter arena in group in same turn, they have synergy present from get-go, they act first in case of synchronisation, their numbers are nearly always bigger than yours. This literally makes all your characters into glass cannons which need to act once or twice and then die for sake of protecting hero. You also don't get any bonuses for clearing waves earlier, like healing, free card play or even just gold.
6. Companions died during battle get injuries. which makes most of them more useless for next battle. Have a lot of WTF moments if your companions team is created for sake of being powerful, but one wrong action (or just happy random for enemy) and it does not matter anymore. This is another BS mechanic which forces player to act in specific way and not play with deckbuilding as they want.

Until these problems are solved and changes aren't made, my review would stay negative, which is probably forever.

P.S. Okay, they remade it.","0.401107758283615112","1681890880","true","602","618","0","73","0","0","0","0"

Otherwise quite fun.

Edit: Just beat the game for the first time and realised the boss I was talking about is actually the final boss.

It's initially quite challenging as you get used to how to play and keeps it's difficulty up, by [spoiler]literally making you fight yourself[/spoiler].

The game definitely gets more fun the more you unlock and you will likely get quite a bit of play time out of it. The only downside i have, is that some runs become frustrating if you get unlucky, but that's the idea of the game, it would be boring if you were always lucky.

The game itself feels to me like a nice try gone wrong...sadly. 

My main problems are that this game relies on far to many rng factors which often lead to a predetermined fate. Not the typical rng dmg range, but within the kinda complex unit and positioning system. Many cards in the game kinda counter each other, sometimes on very basic levels. Lets just take my recent example: 

I picked a hero which is low hp, but gets shields on kills. In my boss fight I encounterd a front hero boss with big hp (leading to no shields for my hero), which was acompanied by the most low level snowman units. 1dmg to a random of mine...1 dmg...to a random. Exactly. You already got it. I had a nice card deck with much synergy, but there was no way to protect my hero from the randomly incoming damage. Ignoring my prays the gods of the dices decided to kill my leader by cute little rng raining down on him.

For this particular example it might help to patch a defensive and offensive mode to your units, making them skip a turn to get defense instead. In general the game would need more control over the units. It's just one example, there are many. You can have VERY GOOD runs and cards, you will sooner or later encounter something that is basically designed to beat you... therefore: I also really want to give this game a negative recommendation!

BUT I know the artist and I know game development myself. It's long journey with many decisions and many risks. The devs made a decision and created a game which can actually be some fun. If you are a masochist who loves to be kicked in the balls every now and then for no proper reason it might even become your favourite! Therefore... take my positive review, but be assured that it contains quite some salt.","0","1727088803","true","1117","1635","0","11","0","0","0","0"

Sure, I lose a lot, but more often than not, it's my fault for not fully reading the cards' abilities and effects. Still, even after countless defeats, the game keeps me hooked. It’s a testament to how well-designed Wildfrost is; losing never feels too frustrating, and when you finally win, the satisfaction is unmatched.

The game’s standout feature is its faction system. You can choose between three distinct groups, each offering a unique playstyle that caters to different strategies. My favorite is the Shademancers (the summoner faction), which allows you to summon units to the board and create a fun, chaotic playfield. The variety between the factions adds great replayability and keeps things fresh each run.

What I appreciate most is that Wildfrost rewards learning and adapting. Every run helps you understand the mechanics better, and even after hours of play, I find myself discovering new synergies and strategies. Losing feels less like a dead-end and more like a stepping stone toward mastering the game.

In conclusion, Wildfrost is one of those roguelikes that challenges you but makes every win feel hard-earned and rewarding. Its complex, layered card mechanics and engaging faction system, especially with my beloved Shademancers, keep me coming back for 'just one more run.'","0","1727068093","true","1207","1707","68","4","0","0","0","0"

The star of it all is the combat system. All actions being on a countdown may feel odd at first, but it proves itself to be the game's greatest strength once you find just how many cards, character and charms. There's so many different strats that can be built, from buff stacking to passive damage to turn stalling, rarely does it feel like two runs played the same. Health and damage numbers are just right enough for battles not to go on for too long, while not being a pushover either. 

Actually I lied, the best part is actually the art style. I never knew I needed a whole game in Gaziter's art style but now I have it and am eating up every corner of it. Tasty stuff.","0.523809552192687988","1727038865","true","1172","1173","1","21","207","1","0","0"

The rules are the most complex for sure, with a LOT of status effect to get use to for example. It may also be more frustrating to lose a run because you have a lot of thing to pay attention to on your screen, and each run is quite long (40 min to 1 hour). But it is my favorite game form this genre so far! I find the progression through the run less frustrating than in other deckbuilding roguelikes as you can get a lot of card and get rid of the bad starting card fast (except with the second tribe which for me is the hardest to build around). The charm system, allowing to modify any card in a lot of different way, is what makes every run so unique. Also I don't usually pay attention to music, but after 41 hours playing this is the only strategy game I don't end up muting after several hours, they are so nice! After unlocking everything I might not come back to it as I would for the other title I mentioned, but for the price range and the solid twists it brings to the genre, I don't regret any of the hours I spent on it.","0","1726995886","true","2468","2758","0","1","0","0","0","0"

For starters, let's talk about gameplay. The core gameplay of Wildfrost is simple: play cards, move your Companion cards around, fight the foes, and win. But it's a bit more complicated then just that. For starters, it has a very unique battle system where every card you play puts every Companion, Clunker, and enemy a step closer to attacking. When one's counter gets to 0, they attack and it fills up again. This means that the name of the game is effeciency - the faster you can turn your foes into a fine goo, the better.

Outside of battle there are but a handful of things that can happen in the brief road between the past and the next fiends to come. You may see a treasure that allows you to take one of three items if you wish, a block of ice containing three companions, one of which you may take, a simple shop starring a woman on a silky snail, and more! The game may sound repetitive and quickly getting boring, but that's the fun part.

It doesn't.

Each move you make, each card you take, each careful decision - each and every one can make the run. Play your cards right and emerge victorious, or fail and fall to the harsh frost. Truly an incredible experience and one I highly recommend everyone look at gameplay for. RTGame in particular has done a couple videos on Wildfrost, and i'd recommend you watch his first video. The second is modded and gets into some spoiler territory, so unless you really need your mind sold i'd recommend diving in immediately after.

Asides from gameplay, one other thing I adore is the presentation - particularly the art style and songs. The Wildfrost soundtrack is composed by Paul Zimmermann and has a total of 14 songs. It may sound small, but the majority of the soundtrack is incredible. Like, just listen to Winter's Wrath alone and you'll have a transcendent moment. Wildfrost's art meanwhile is quite simple and cute, yet super pleasing. Each and every card is individually drawn with not a single recolor, which is pretty impressive considering how each battle has 5 or so unique enemies and how there are hundreds of cards outside of this. Furthermore, you may notice things such as the lore and cards bleeding in combat. I personally like this. It shows that the land of Wildfrost is harsh and dangerous, to the point of death being canonical and bluntly said.

Overall, Wildfrost is an incredible experience I recommend any Roguelike fan plays. The only criticism I have is that there are only 3 tribes and a bit under 30 total battles, but with how many cards are in the game this is fair enough.","0","1726701706","true","495","2109","102","47","0","0","0","0"

Would it kill you guys to add more clarity, when you're about to end-turn and kill your leader?

Just SHOW ME. Don't make me do all the work of guessing WTF will happen next turn when there's so many different effects happening. It is NOT fun to lose a team you loved, with zero warning you were about to walk off a cliff.

Mousing-over every single character, every single turn, and trying to calculate WTF will happen as they chain together, IS NOT FUN.

All true, but so very entertaining as well. I do love me a chill soundtrack and the way it ramps difficulty is interesting and fun. I won't spoil it, but you will see.

My last run put the fear of God in me and aged me 10 years, but I won't be stopping and would not have it any other way.

Doesn't mean it isn't fun though, my favorite aspect of the game is probably how the characters you clear the final boss with replace those enemies until defeated later. So if you supe up your characters and win, you'll have a greater challenge next time.
I seem to almost always fight the same bosses (Infernoko + Krunker), I think another possible boss for each boss node would've added to the diversity of runs. I love the fact that you can rename all your cards though, makes for some pretty funny runs.

It offers a fresh take on the roguelike deckbuilder genre with interesting mechanics. The twist on the final boss mechanics is definitely interesting and very fun ([spoiler]Your units become the new final boss[/spoiler]). While it can get too much, the game offers a lot of ways to make every run doable and fun.

With all that said, I find it kinda funny how the game goes the extra mile to counter save scumming. The game saves every single turn in a fight so you can't just restart the battle after a blunder unlike in many other similar games. And with how much can happen in a single turn, it is very possible to blunder and not foresee how the turn would go. 

The save file is also pretty hard to edit too so some of the more frustrating unlocks and achievements can be really hard to annoying to get. Every achievement in the game unlocks a new charm, which is an upgrade in the game. So not being able to unlock that one charm because of frustrating RNG or insane requirements is pretty annoying. Special shout out too to the final pet unlock requiring you to wipe a full enemy pack (6) in one turn when you rarely ever get 6 enemies on the field or have the necessary damage and upgrades to wipe all of them in one turn. Challenges are fun but locking unit unlocks and upgrades behind them while making them gimmicky is frustrating.","0","1725740292","true","884","2554","49","40","0","0","0","0"

I haven't seen such a unique deckbuilder anywhere else and the team keeps working on fun new additions to an already perfect game. Highly recommend.","0.546912491321563721","1725329656","true","733","2299","0","16","0","2","0","0"

With over a year of updates to the game I want to amend and better reflect my opinion on the game. There are a couple things from my previous review (below) that are still true. The main change is the overall difficulty of the game is drastically less initially, and the game feels more fair than it did in the past. While it is still possible to lose runs, now I feel like I made the wrong choices in plays or cards rather than I was just unlucky. 

Also the final boss/bosses of each run feel way more doable. For those who haven't beaten the game once skip to the next paragraph. The final boss before felt like you needed a god run to win, but now it feels like you just need a good run which is much nicer. However, that's not to say the final boss can't become unbeatable, as since the final boss is your last run that 'won' you can end up in the situation I did, where he was an absolute nightmare. Let me tell you the story of Nib, the strongest character I have ever had. Nib was of the Clunkmasters, with mediocre health and damage, but he would increase his damage every time he activated. I grabbed him and began the journey gaining allies and items when I obtained my first charm, the Chucklefish charm granting unlimited charm slots. It was at that moment an insidious idea crossed my mind, 'What if I put EVERY charm on him?'. I assumed I would lose immediately, it's not going to work, but as we cleared encounter after encounter Nib grew from mediocrity to a divine being, carrying encounters on his own and becoming unstoppable. Finally the Final boss came and I gave Nib his final charm, leaving him with Ink, Demonize, +1 Strength on activation, Restore 3 health on kill, Fury 4, Yank, Barrage and he began with 1 Block. We swept my previous run with ease and as I heard the victory jingle I realized my mistake, Nib had become god, and now I had to defeat him. And yet despite him being insanely strong and potentially unbeatable, I wasn't frustrated because this was my mistake. I knew that he would be the final boss if I won and I still did what I did. For this moment alone and the sheer excitement/terror of having to fight him again this game is amazing. And I hope everyone who plays has their own Nib story or moment.

Overall what I had originally believed to be a  7-8/10 game has definitely rose to a 9/10. Highly recommend playing it if you can. Wildfrost is a game that can absolutely stand toe to toe with other major Roguelite Deckbuilders such as Balatro and Slay the Spire. Also major props to the developer for adding in mod support as well! I can't wait to see how many mods will take off and I truly hope the community for this game lasts for a long time!


Old Review: April 2023

As a fan of roguelite deckbuilders this game piqued my interest from the moment I saw it, however with the initial mixed reviews I was unsure if I should pick it up. Inevitably I picked it up and discovered how wrong I was for hesitating as long as I did. However, about 20-ish runs later, I began to see some of the concerns for the game, and now having done 37 runs over the course of 12 hours I think it's about right to review Wildfrost. If you are looking for a short yes or no, the answer is yes, and on a scale of 1-10 I would say 7 or 8/10. However if you want my full opinions they are below.

The randomized starting characters are definitely a mechanic that I enjoy, but I can see how it can be disliked. There are definitely starts where instead of picking the option I want most I am instead picking the least bad option. What makes Wildfrost addicting and unable to put down is absolutely the core gameplay loop which is an interesting blend of deckbuilder auto-battler. Playing a card triggers every other card's countdown, but moving and rearranging units does not allowing you to maneuver your tank to block the hits or move your squishies to the other lane to avoid being attacked. Sometimes you want to rearrange your units so one can apply a debuff before your other unit attacks for increased damage. It requires you to think and plan ahead, and it can be brutal. 

Once you are out of combat there are events to go to before the next fight, some giving you new allies, some new items, and some charms, a mechanic that gives this game another level of depth. Charms allow you to give cards an additional effect, be it applying a new effect, dealing more or less damage, or not taking up your turn. Every card has a max of three charms, and these charms can take a seemingly useless card into a powerhouse, and vice versa.

However, there are some flaws that can be very frustrating to deal with if you are unprepared, or used to other games like Slay the Spire. Cards can be played on the cards in your hand, which led to me pulling out a card to use, realizing a different card was better and trying to put it back into my hand, and then accidentally playing the original to a card I didn't want and effectively wasting my turn. While not a horrible flaw, it is an infuriating one initially.

[**Now, lets talk difficulty, something to take with a grain of salt and by far the most divisive part of the game. Out of those 37 runs, I believe 6 of them have made it the 'Final Boss', and 2-3 of them have made it to Stage 2. Only 1 had even a chance of beating it and lost due to random chance. So is it ungodly difficult? No, but it isn't perfectly balanced either. Personally the final boss feels unfair, and I think this is my biggest criticism of the game. Not every build will work on everything, which is understandable, however some encounters are just run-enders for certain builds regardless of how effective the build is. The difference/problem is, instead of being difficult but possible, it is/feels impossible and you can tell how it will end from the start, but you are stuck waiting for the game to kill you. Perhaps I am wrong, but there doesn't seem to be a forfeit run button anywhere, which would be appreciated. While some encounters are build-enders, they don't feel nearly as unfair the Final Boss, who feels intentionally designed just to be mean. With such high health and damage growth to not only itself but its constant swarm of allies it can turn into an impossible gauntlet that can't be overcome. If I had to suggest an option, perhaps instead of making the damage growth permanent on the minions, make it temporary, or have it go away when the phases change, because having a multi-attacking minion dealing upwards of 60 a swing does not feel fun to go against.** ] (New opinion above!) 

Also, the unlock/upgrade system while neat, can feel very unrewarding and I wish there was more. Every unlock is linked to a corresponding challenge, however they only unlock at the end of a run and you can only work on the first in line rather than all of them at once. It makes the challenges feel padded out rather than feeling like genuine accomplishments. If I may make a suggestion and allow for minor customization that is unlocked through runs, for example, like town decorations or card/character additions that can be bought by currency obtained in runs. Or perhaps ways to improve existing events, like shop restocks or resets, starting character resets, more choices, etc etc. Currently, it feels like I have achieved nearly everything and it makes returning to town feel like a wasted choice.

With all of that said, Wildfrost is an addicting but brutal roguelite deckbuilder and one I will probably play for many hours. If this game every gets mod-support I will probably put in double or triple that time.","0","1682249772","true","1337","1645","0","9","354","0","0","0"

Having to manage positioning on the battlefield as well as cards in your hand adds a very welcome layer of strategy (though I would have liked to see more effects interacting with positioning a la Darkest Dungeon)
My favorite feature is charms. Rather than each card or ally upgrading into the same slightly-better version each run (like in Slay the Spire and most other similar games), you can instead attach charms to impart various effects. This adds a fantastic amount of creativity and directions you can take your strategy.
The artstyle is very charming and the music is great and the meta-progression keeps things moving forward.
This is an extremely worthy pickup if you have any interest in the genre.

Balance has improved, the difficulty curve is less right-angled, and the player has more control over what happens in their runs. Choices for improving your deck and run are much harder and less tunnel-visioned, and the addition of more content and modding support has made runs less repetitive and more engaging. 
Almost all of my issues with the game at launch have been fixed. However, one still remains; for I still think the game is overall lacking in content. You will likely still not play this game for a million hours in the way that you would Slay the Spire, as there is simply not enough cards to fuel a consistently fresh experience. Despite that, I'm already noticing myself having much more fun with the game upon my return to it, and I'm very grateful to the developers for continually taking feedback and improving the experience. I look forward to seeing how the game continues growing.
Also, the soundtrack is incredible and always has been. That's a big bonus.

---

OLD REVIEW: I'm now 30 hours in, roughly. I think my overall opinion on the game has improved somewhat as I have also personally improved, however the broad strokes of my opinions still remain.

What I am learning is that the game's balance is simply awful. It's not that the game is too difficult to complete, but rather that the game is heavily overcentralized on a few items, mechanics, and limitations, and does not properly balance certain other mechanics around these. 
The most notable example that comes to mind is Crowns. Shops are the only way in this game to obtain Crowns, a mechanic that allows you to draw and play a card for free at the start of combat. Playing almost any card has the same cost as another, so Crowns are vitally important to winning a run, and you are unlikely to succeed if you do not utilize the Combo mechanic (wherein you line up several enemy kills in one turn to gain an increasing amount of money per kill) to afford and purchase as many Crowns as possible. This is not 'bad' in theory, but in practice heavily discourages many different potential strategies in the game in favor of running similar builds with multihits and AOE attacks. 
This compounds with the fact that many builds, monster cards (the game refers to them as Companions), and items range between blatantly overpowered (like Krono) and virtually unusable (like Vesta). Furthermore, using the combo mechanic usually requires deliberately stalling out combats for extended periods of time, which I actually don't hate as it's very satisfying to get large combos, but it can make the game take a very long time to complete a run.
Finally, the game is critically lacking in content. There's only a little under 160 cards in the game, most of which are non-companion items, and/or classless general purpose cards. And in terms of unique combats, while each combat has its own unique mechanics and enemy patterns, so each one effectively feels like a boss fight--there is only 6 true 'bosses' in the game, and only 13 non-boss combats in the game. It can make runs feel very repetitive very quickly when you can play two runs back-to-back where your deck build and your enemies encountered remain almost entirely unchanged.
With all this said, I'm not hating the game, as evidenced by putting 30 hours into it. I will probably play it more. The developers are very good with community feedback and are visibly putting their best efforts forward in improving the game. At this pace, I don't believe many of the issues that I have with the game will remain.

Overall, I'd say to wait for a couple of patches to see if the experience improves somewhat.","0.465118199586868286","1682034094","true","271","15932","0","38","0","0","0","0"

The balancing is way off regarding companion strength, and you'll have to fight whatever companions (and your main character!) won you the last run, but it's surprisingly easy to force a hypercarry either through scaling ATK values on multi-hit carries, or via characters that increase their ATK stat when you do something notable (like healing, or more realistically the one that increases ATK when junk is recycled). 

Note that since you have to fight your last roster, I found it to be an entirely valid strategy to have your main carry be extraordinarily fragile, this way you can immediately take them out when you face your old self.","0.485792845487594604","1724388875","true","981","981","0","13","127","1","0","0"

Highly polished with tons of different mechanics, and most importantly a clear focus on building absurd synergies. But even as you build the most broken deck composition, you find that the game keeps challenging you just because the enemy variety has such unique strategies that will expose any flaws in your deck.

It's hard to explain in a short review, but everything just works the way you want it to if you understand how to read and interpret keywords on cards. Are you unsure if this effect applies if used in this niche, seemingly unintended way? The answer is basically always yes.

All that being said, the game is hard. Very hard. If building a deck in slay the Spire is an exponential rocket ship blasting into the stratosphere at higher and higher speeds, Wildfrost is finely tuned machinery that when calibrated correctly and with enough thought, allows you to pull off incredible combos and travel through time, probably.

The 2 lane mechanics, the round countdown, companions and the ability to recall and move them around as needed, the 'protect the king' gameplay, the way the game establishes rules and mechanics and then introduces cards that immediately break them, it's all flawlessly executed.

On top of everything that makes the gameplay so fun and addicting(and that loss where you mess up a good run so traumatizing), the art style is adorable, the animations are great at providing that satisfying chain reaction feedback from a good move, and the music is equally charming and catchy. Definitely the best use of adaptive music in a deckbuilder I can think of.

Oh, and the devs are still putting out free updates with new enemies, cards and companions and there's daily challenge runs if you ever get bored of the main mode, which I might add has a system simiilar to StS ascension levels.

10/10 deckbuilder. If this is your genre, this is your game.","0.580419540405273438","1724245786","true","2088","3277","0","5","0","4","0","0"

Best advice I can give is focus on completing the achievements and stick to unlocking more card options faster. Pets and Noomlings (which make cards that have Noomlings on cost you no turns when played) are just nice to have.

Overall though the end game didn't keep me hooked. Not enough card tribes to choose as starters despite there being clearly a good amount of archtypes to play the game still feels pretty limited on choice.

I'd like to pick a Berry Tribe, Poison specialist tribe. Do more than just rely on rng to build those sets.

Overall you get your money's worth and then some. Might buy again if they offer more better starting options than the three tribes you get. Already beat game with Junkers as my first run. Ice and Shadow left.

Junkers by far were the most fun of the three imo.

Replayability is moderately high. For me an easy 4/5.

Difficulty is pretty high given how RNG your starting triber and followers can be. Some runs literally make or break if you don't have the right abilities or charms and bells. One misplay will cost you a whole run. Your mileage will vary but it can be pretty brutal. Again, if only due to limited choices on some runs. RNG is RNG.

In short, if you're going to play know that losing and restarting is part of the gaming experience. You're not supposed to win in one go. Can. But not designed to. Check the town and read what's required to unlock them. Faster you do the more fun you'll start to have and make RNG feel less punishing, sort of.

A great game. Worth it if you've got time to kill. Also while not a card game I would recommend all checkout Backpack Hero. A wonderful roguelike that many who play this I feel would enjoy.","0.472551792860031128","1723978086","true","795","795","0","15","0","0","0","0"

Upgrading card yourself by adding charm effects, making decisions should you hit the redraw bell or not, choosing what storm bells you want to add to make your runs more difficult are amazing mechanics that make this game very unique to me. A huge majority of the time I die in this game is because I didn't notice that the enemy was buffing someone/attacking or had frenzy which is a run loss I'm always fine with.

I initially liked Wild Frost -- it added some new mechanics to the Deckbuilding Roguelike/roguelite genre and had some neat  concepts as far as its 'classes' (more like 'families'). 

After playing this about 8 hours (mostly on Switch), I felt like the game was lacking in endgame content.  I felt like I had the game 'beat' and could win on any run, assuming I didn't get abyssmal RNG.  

Final boss became a piece of cake (early on there was only 1, I believe they have added at least 1 other but not sure), and there were only so many viable builds.  In fact some of the mechanics in the game were just not viable, or at least not very fun to play. 

In the end, I ended up feeling disappointed in this game. I felt like it had a lot of promise, but once you get to endgame, it's over.  Except for this genre, the endgame should be where the challenge really picks up. 

So, ultimately, I feel like the game doesn't offer enough for the pricepoint.

Only have 9 hours on the game, but i played the Demo. I love it. Everything about it is wonderful, the Art is beutiful and fun, i can get lost in the art for days at a time. The gameplay going to get some use to, but after a few games you will get the hang of it. The replay ability is like any rouge like game, repetitive with the same cards, but this game has unlocking in the early stages so that is boring with all cards unlocked. 

Overall a 9/10 i think i have a basic understanding of all the keywords, but i still die randomly

New review:
I now have 69 hours in the game. Now i can say its a wonderful game. I had a bit of a break but have just now come back to the game after a big update. Its so easy to come back to. The replayability is amazing, and hunting for achivements is fun! 

I rate this game a 10/10.

Drawing heavily from the grandfather of the genre - slay the spire - Wildfrost iterates on the formula quite well.  A unique countdown timer on each combatant gives the player immense foresight into how the battle is going to go, telegraphing everything far in advance.  Coupled with the ability to reposition your fighters on the fly to dictate who trades blows with who gives the player an immense amount of agency.  This is a refreshing change from slay the spire, where a run could fall apart due to a single bad hand.  
Graphics:
Cute!

The turn based count down system is super interesting and sets it apart from the other ones I've tried, very refreshing from the basic 'cards cost energy to play' approach. It opens up a new set of tactics, and gives you new challenges to consider in a card game: recalling companions is something that I didn't truly understand the value of until a few runs in. It opens up all new play patterns for a card game!

Overall very easy to understand, though there is the occasional interaction that feels difficult to predict. Most notably for me is it's not clear that 'Aimless' completely overrides 'Barrage' and not the other way around, though once you learn these quirks they're predictable. There's a few other minor gotchas like this throughout the game where I just had to make a play and hope it worked out how I guessed it would. I also wish that it was more clear which charms are legal to apply on which cards on occasion.

I've heard complaints about the difficulty in this game, but it was never an issue for me. Perhaps balance changes since release have made this a lesser issue, but I started with a three run winstreak upon first picking up the game. Every run seems winnable and almost all my losses I can point to mistakes which caused them. The game isn't completely brutal, my favorite fights are ones where I make a crucial mistake and end up losing an important companion for the fight, but end up scraping together a win anyways.

Also the mechanic where [spoiler]your previous winning team becoming the boss of the next run[/spoiler] is probably my favorite in any roguelike deck builder. It basically adds infinite variety, though sometimes you'll have to take cards you wouldn't have otherwise in order to plan around it.

My only complaint is that the unlocking of additional cards seems a bit superfluous and slow. Not only is there only a handful of new cards to unlock, they are unlocked via specific requirements. This wouldn't be so bad, but each pet, item, and companion can only be unlocked one of a time in a set order. If you could work on all the unlocks simultaneously it'd feel less grindy to get to all the content.

Still, I'd heavily recommend this game to anyone who loves deck building roguelikes!","0.548872172832489014","1723122342","true","1687","2060","0","3","208","3","0","0"

Slay the Spire takes third believe it or not. But out of all the games of that genre I've ever played, this one has BY FAR the most polish. Its deceivingly easy to jump into, = so its simple to learn, but there's a lot of depth and there are some absolutely crazy synergies and combos you can pull off, I'm still finding new ones. Originally bought on ios, (which I actually really like playing on, its much more comfortable than a mouse), but I bought a second copy on steam just because I could not wait for the latest update to come to ios lol, was to excited for all the new cards.

Have probably put 200 hours into this game between this copy and the ios one, still learning and improving. It absolutely can be difficult, and I wont disagree with people that say it can punish you for a single mistake, but I think this game perfectly balances that difficulty with just the right amount of complexity that is manageable, to keep you on your toes and stop you from becoming complacent. If it were any more complex it could be overwhelming, and less and it could get boring. I also think people that struggle are often coming for Slay the Spire and are approaching the game with old habits. I struggled a lot to at first but something finally clicked for me, and started to understand the nuances of this games strategy. Its super unique, so it doesnt surprise me its challenging for a lot of deckbuilding roguelike veterans. 

Also really excellent game for people to new to the genre, as it doesnt overwhelm you with technical terms and card mechanics, its all so straightforward you'd be fooled into thinking the game is simple and kid friendly (the cute art made a lot of people surprised at how challenging the game can be), but despite all that its INCREDIBLY rewarding. Thank you Chucklefish for this absolute gem PLEASE MAKE MORE GAMES LIKE THIS.

I'll admit there were times when you just had bad luck, but most of the time when I failed it was my own fault, which is awesome. I think there could have been a little more fanfare for the true ending, and maybe a little more to interact with in the hub, but that's just icing on the cake I would have preferred.

While it draws inspiration from games like Slay the Spire, it introduces a plethora of unique and engaging elements that set it apart. Each run, typically lasting about 30 minutes, involves strategic decisions on a map where you collect cards to build your deck and charms to enhance your cards.

As a fan of roguelike deckbuilders – having spent considerable time with Balatro, Inscryption, and Slay the Spire – Wildfrost immediately clicked with me. The game has provided a thoroughly enjoyable experience, and after approximately 32 hours, I managed to reach the true ending. Although Wildfrost may not offer infinite replayability, it does feature daily challenges to extend its longevity. Nevertheless, over 30 hours of engaging gameplay from such an affordable and polished game is undeniably a great value. In fact, I found myself enjoying Wildfrost even more than Slay the Spire, which is often hailed as the king of the genre.

Wildfrost is quite challenging at first until you become accustomed to how the many different cards and effects work together to create intricate synergies. It took me about eight or so attempts to complete my first successful run – and another fifteen or twenty to defeat the [i]new[/i] boss. I won’t spoil it here, but the game has an interesting mechanic in regards to boss fights. However, once I started learning more about synergies and what the best cards are (I [i]might’ve[/i] looked up tier lists and some guides online after hours of getting nowhere), the game became quite a bit easier, leading me to obtain a 5-run win streak.

The game is difficult until you master it, at which point it becomes fairly easy. The gameplay is highly different from any other roguelike deckbuilder I’ve played – it’s not just a carbon copy of Slay the Spire. Since I’m comparing these two games, I would say, although I did actually enjoy Wildfrost more than Slay the Spire, Slay the Spire does have more depth and strategy potential, as well as more replay value, compared to Wildfrost.

Ultimately, Wildfrost is a brilliantly charming game with a variety of synergies and strategies. Its beautiful art style and captivating animations enhance the overall experience, making it a must-play for fans of the genre. The best piece of advice I could possibly give to you is: purchase the ‘Kind of a BIG DEAL’ bundle, containing both Balatro and Wildfrost, both absolutely phenomenal games.","0","1722955816","true","2010","5294","320","32","119","0","1","0"

A minor criticism is that until the second area of the game, most decks will look boring, but it will ramp up in difficulty really quickly after the first major boss in the game.

Don't come into this expecting it to play like either however; Wildfrost is a much more 'compressed' experience in the sense that decks remain small, gameplay very tactical turn-by-turn, and heavily emphasizes its own mechanics over conventionally established genre mechanics.

Top notch art, sound and concept design overall; some mechanics are a bit frustrating, but overall the whole of Wildfrost is an incredible package.

If you approach it as its own game and learn how to play it, there's a very rewarding game underneath. However, it is quite difficult/punishing of mistakes, so this is probably not a great deckbuilder for those just starting out or without taking time to familiarize yourself with how important its unique mechanics are. Great examples of this: when to take crowns vs charms, understanding when to invest/build around 1 card as a win condition vs your deck as a whole, and being comfortable with using HP as a resource due to the movement system in the game.","0","1722846039","true","6310","6322","0","16","0","0","0","0"

It's an absolutely fantastic game, especially since the last couple updates. 

The long and short of the gameplay is you choose a 'faction' and the game generates 3 heroes for you to take on a journey. Each hero will have various stats- health, attack, counter (how many turns between attacks) and extra attributes that trigger at various points in gameplay.
Each faction has a different gameplay style and get unlocked by completing the previous one. It's worth unlocking them all, as the last one is easily the most fun in my opinion.
Over the course of gameplay you can also pick up 'charms' which you can permanently add to a card on your run to buff it in various ways. These are ABSOLUTELY the best part of the game in my opinion. It's insanely fun to find ways to completely break cards and turn them into an overpowered mess.

During the gameplay you pick up various companions- other NPC cards- and items. There are quite a few types of deck you can work towards during your run and the game is just easy enough (especially after the last update) to switch from one deck to another mid-run if your card pickups aren't ideal. Unlike some other deckbuilders, it's quite difficult to actually end up with a deck full of garbage you won't use. You may only pick up a dozen cards in your whole run, plus there are options to delete cards during runs.

When I first started playing the game was pretty difficult and it took me a good 5-6 runs to actually win. There have been some good updates since then and it's much easier to finish a run, but it does still feel like a challenge!
The last boss is especially fun once you start completing runs, as you get better at the game the boss definitely scales with you.

There are unlockable features, more charms, cards and companions. You unlock these by completing various challenges over your runs. I find it best to work towards several challenges at once rather than just the one, as some runs you just won't find the cards you need to do certain ones.

The game itself is gorgeous, it has a really nice art style and is super smooth. The music is also lovely and even changes from the start of a fight to the first time you attack! Nice touch.

If you're a fan of deckbuilders, roguelikes or just a fun card game you can pick up and play with just your mouse, please do give this game a try. It's so cheap for the hours of gameplay you can get from it!","0.523809552192687988","1722813784","true","1633","2751","0","7","0","2","0","0"

The countdown mechanic for example and many other features like the charm system (although it's similar to upgrading your cards in other games) etc is really refreshing. I am not a big fan of the visual design but those things are different from person to person I guess...

1. What really bugs me though is the amount of brain acrobatics that have to be done in fights.
Imagine fighting against 8 enemies with your 8 allies. The playing field is separated into two rows which you can attack. Let's say there are two enemies attacking in both rows and also two of your allies attacking in both rows THIS TURN. Now you have to take into consideration the amount of damage the enemy does (it always attacks first) and the amount of damage your team does. The interesting part happens in planning following turns though. Since the game doesn't tell you how much damage each minion takes (like for example monster train or STS do) you have to juggle damage calculations for several turns yourself. This seems like too much hassle to me.

In my three hours playing there were already times where I wanted to write stuff down just so I don't forget any interaction since they can become quite complex (e.g. retaliation damage of enemies; stuff that happens, when enemies take damage; your minions dying triggers effects; minions applying damage amplification; delaying enemy turns). Keep in mind: you can't do your actions step by step (like STS etc.). You commit to one setup and then all the interactions take place.

I loved this design in Rogue Voltage (would highly recommend) for example, but it's way less convoluted there...

2. Leading up to a boss fight you have maybe four battles. The rest is 'shop / new cards / destroy cards / new charms'-interactions. This doesn't feel nice to me. Getting a new card or upgrading one feels way more exciting when it's either rare or tied to fights. Having maybe ten battles in a whole run feels weird and doesn't teach you which interactions are 'good' in your current build. The enemies being so different from another doesn't help as well...

3. The game tosses almost broken mechanics at you. There is a boss which has about 60 health and each time he takes damage, he increases all damage done by the enemies by that amount. Either you have a crazy snowbally (pun intended) damage/mitigation burst ready or the next couple of turns are going to be hell. Maybe knowledge will make you aware and you would plan future runs accordingly but it felt insane on my second run...

I was able to beat the vanilla game with the first 'race' in my three hours and also did a run with the 2nd race, so progress isn't too slow, but it's one of those game that doesn't feel particularly rewarding while playing (looking at you, inscription, monster train, STS, Balatro, Against the Storm, Rogue Voltage etc.) so I don't think I'll come back :(","0.463223785161972046","1722622681","false","189","189","0","12","276","1","0","0"

I, leaving a positive review, am here to say it's unfair. But like, in a fun way. Like you encounter a truly terrifying looking card and you're like 'how the hell do I do this,' and then you figure out how to do this. You'll die, a lot, and it may get frustrating, but that's just how a roguelike works. You'll devise the most powerful incredible strategy you possibly can and then encounter a battle with like The Exact Counter to your strategy. You'll start a run just to try to get an achievement, not expecting to make it halfway through, and then you'll make it all the way to the ending. It's a lot, and I mean this positively.

The art, music, world, sound design, sensory feel of actions, and overall vibes are awesome. The mechanics, simple enough to understand, can get rather insane and such insanity is encouraged. I've not played a lot of deck-building card games or even roguelikes, but I really like this one, and I think I may play more games in that sort of genre because of this one. 

I think the bad reviews are from people who don't appreciate the sort of insanity the fights can reach, or even start off with, and I understand that. Some people want more serious of a challenge, and this game offers a different sort of challenges then they may be after, if that makes sense. But personally I find it great. And if you are patient with the sort of thing that takes a lot of trying over and over again, and what I've described sounds good to you, then you might, too!","0","1722479816","true","1197","5591","443","10","0","0","0","0"

However, I find it's a tad brutal. One mistake can cost you the entire run. There are so many possibilities of what could happen on some rounds due to rng abilities like 'Aimless', and when that causes you to lose it feels really bad. I was able to beat a run twice, and have gotten close many more times, only to lose to rng or me not paying 100% attention. In slay the spire your character would lose health and you could recover, but since your hero has such low hp its pretty common for them to get wiped out in a single attack. It's also annoying you have to spend so much time to unlock cards, I'd really like them to be given faster. Overall a high quality deckbuilder, but I am choosing not to recommend it because its just not fun for me to invest so much time into a run and to lose so unforgivingly.","0.539565443992614746","1722386872","false","674","674","0","11","0","6","0","0"

And from Slay The Spire To Balatro to Inscryption, Wildfrost is the one that I have come to enjoy the most and continue to desire to come back to. I only recently got into the game, and I already have put many hours into it. It also has so much content to come back to, making each run through the gauntlet unique and fun. One problem I have with some other deck builders is that it feels as though you MUST play a specific way, else you WILL fail. However, Wildfrost has given me the ability to play in wacky ways which may seem very unlikey to go anywhere, but if played correctly, can become incredibly strong. Likewise, though it is difficult, it is not unfair. If I fail a run, it wasn't due to an unfortunate draw of my deck, but rather my poor choices that led to it. That makes failure more personal, but also makes the successes that much better, as I know it was all because of my efforts and strategies.

Everything about the game is something that I love. The cards and their designs, the charms and their unique abilities, and incredible setting which the game puts us into.

I also enjoy the story quite a bit which it tells. It is a bit vague, so if that is all you care about, you may not enjoy it quite as much, but it gives the game a nice hint of mystery. 

The only complaint that I have with the game is that I wish there was the ability to have a longer run. I love my builds and teams, but sometimes feel like my time with them is over too quickly. But that is just another reason why this game is so good. I just want it to continue and keep going. I want to put my skills to the test even further than I have. 
I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good card game, and deck builder. The game play is fantastic, the music incredible, the design is great, and I know that I will be coming back to this game very soon.","0.523333311080932617","1722317970","true","1302","1308","0","2","0","2","0","0"

The biggest sticking point for me is the balancing. The bosses and enemies felt too tanky and strong while any cards I would get felt too weak and frail. Enemies are not only strong, but they almost always attack in groups. The wave bell is always counting down, so while you're trying to chip away at the first wall, even more enemies will quickly show up. It's very easy to lose just by being overwhelmed because you have very few cards to put on the field. For the first two battles it's not too bad, but once you get past the third fight it starts to feel really unfair. This is made worse by the fact that the game is very stingy when it comes to collecting new cards or improving the ones you already have. You can only get new cards from the shops or events on the map, while other games would give you the option to get new cards immediately after you win a battle. 

Opportunities to increase your Champions' HP are far too rare; the only ways to do so is to equip a card with an HP-boosting charm or to choose a specific bell after you win enough fights. The problem is, this game is very luck-based, so you might not even see these charms or the bell for several runs. The fact that your cards' HP is so low compared to the mid to late game enemies makes clearing runs a pain. Especially considering that having your Leader die leads to an instant Game Over. Even though there are cards you can use in battle to heal HP, they just feel too weak to be useful. Restoring your character's health by 3 doesn't really help if you're fighting a squad of enemies that can do 4 or more damage per hit.

While there are charms in the game that can enhance certain cards, they have their own problems. There are some that are generally very useful, such as one that increases the card's attack or another that lowers a card's cooldown period. However, the charm pool also has some that are only useful in very niche deck builds. Sure, you might get lucky and get the best charms fairly quickly in one run, but in another run you might get charms that are useless for the deck you have.

The worst thing about the game is one fight at the end of the game. [spoiler]When you win this fight, the characters you used that run get copied and you have to fight the copies the next time you reach the end. Not only that, but the clones have their stats boosted more than when you used them. Also, the copying happens every time you win.[/spoiler] Because the game is so unbalanced, you basically need an OP deck to even reach the end, let alone beat this fight. And to get an OP deck requires a lot of luck. This just feels very discouraging to the point where I basically lost all interest in the game after only a few successful runs.

The amount of cards, charms, and enemies are too low in this game and there are only 3 playable tribes. It's to the point where I've seen almost all of the content before I even cleared one run. The game got tedious very quickly for me because I was fighting the same enemies with the same cards. Even unlockable charms and cards don't really help, since those are also lacking. While a recent update added some new cards and bosses, it feels like too little too late at this point.

Overall, this game had a lot of potential, but it was kind of squandered. The fights tend to be slow and drawn out because the gulf between your power and enemy health is too wide. Getting a deck that actually feels strong instead of just barely good enough feels like winning the lottery, but in a bad way. Clearing a run can be summed up as 'Congrats, you killed the man-eating tiger! Here's your prize: a fight against three man-eating tigers for later!'","0.629966199398040771","1722192240","false","5490","6701","0","3","0","29","0","0"

I've been playing Wildfrost on and off with the new patch updates. Kudos to the developer team for updating their game in a timely manner. I still think the game is lacking in features that other great roguelikes have, but with the price point being 20 USD and a lot of the major issues I had at launch fixed, I will in fact recommend this game now. I'll go over each of my negative points and explain what the developers have done to address the issues.

1) The developers solved the problem of the fact that you have to fight a super powered version of your previous run by just adding more ways to power yourself up. It's somewhat similar to Slay the Spires end of rewards at the act where it's a super powered artifact. These are big changes such as giving you more draws, increasing the wave counter, flat damage increase to all cards in your deck, etc. It's a simple way to give the player a power spike, but it's effective enough.

2) Companions and Charms (upgrades) being too RNG dependent is still a problem. They fixed Card RNG by allowing you to not choose a card when given the choice (although you receive no benefit for refusing the offer). There's more options for Charms now with Charm merchants and the aforementioned end of  act rewards giving you the choice of a powerful charm, but it's still too RNG dependent for my liking. Companions are unchanged. It's better, but not having any reroll options or any way to guarantee certain companions or charms is a major issue that curbed a lot of the enjoyment of the game for me.

Overall it's a better experience now, but still lacking in a lot of ways. I have 17.2 hours in the game and that's enough of an experience for me. I've unlocked all but one starting pet companion (the 6x combo one) and a lot of charms/achievements I haven't unlocked yet. I'm mainly giving a positive review because the developers have been consistently updating the game and I think it's at a point where it's an acceptable experience, albeit not as good as the roguelike greats.

[hr] [h1] OLD REVIEW [/h1] [/hr]

8.3 hours in and I have to say this game has a lot of potential. Many reviewers are complaining about the difficulty, but it isn't that hard if you know what you're doing (finished my first run on my 2nd try and subsequently I've cleared 3/8 times). Sadly Wildfrost falls short of a lot of balancing problems with the interactive systems in the game. I really hope the developers continue updating the game and releasing more content. The game is lacking in content. Already 8 hours in and I have over half of all unlockables done and all factions unlocked. For $20 it seems to have around 10 - 15 hours of content, after that it's just the game itself and let me tell you there are huge problems here.

I'm going to assume you already looked at other reviewers and saw the comparisons to Slay the Spire & Monster Train. I won't bore you with those details. Instead I'll focus on the huge problems with the balancing:

Do note there will be slight spoilers in this.

1) By far the most egregious problem has to be after you clear a run. After you complete a run the final boss becomes you, except it's not exactly the same as you because the AI also has extra benefits that your character doesn't have. Usually this is in the form of increased stats or abilities for the main character + all the companions used. There is a problem with this if you cannot already see it. Eventually you'll reach a point where your team was so good at clearing the run, that you yourself will have an extremely difficult time clearing it. Even if you manage to clear the boss, you'll have to get an even better team the next time to clear again... it's a very deteriorating motivator. I have no idea how the developers thought this was balanced because it isn't balanced at all. I've gotten to the final boss 3 times since I last cleared and failed every single time. I just cannot clear the strategy of my final team.

2) Cards & Companions are too RNG dependent. In Monster Train you had a limited selection of the pool of two different factions. In Slay the Spire each character has its own specific pool of cards available (excluding colorless cards). In Wildfrost there does appear to be a limited pool for each faction, but it's very small... too small. There's also neutral Companions and Cards that are available for all factions that further dilutes this pool making strategies pretty difficult to create. This is further exacerbated by the fact that you are FORCED to actually choose cards or companions regardless of whether they suit your playstyle or not. Removing cards is not done possible through the shop system, but through an event that is usually on a different path from the shop which is the only place you can actually buy important upgrades.

3) Speaking of upgrades... it's a very different system. Both Monster Train and Slay the Spire have unique upgrade paths for cards and monsters (in the case of Monster Train). In Wildfrost upgrades are not unique, but generalistic. When you go to an upgrade shop (or an upgrade node) you get a random chance to get upgrades from a very large pool. Let's say you get a health increase upgrade. You can put that on your companion to increase their health or put it on a healing spell to increase the healing potential. Similarly, a shield upgrade can be used to give +1 shield to a companion or +1 shield gain on a spell. The upgrades are permanent and you cannot remove them. The problem here is again the pool is far too vast on what is available in the upgrade shop. You can go to a shop and get upgrades for things you do not need or cannot use, it's a completely random system. You can imagine the frustration of spending all your gold trying to get a health upgrade for  your tank only to get nothing even useable.


It's a shame too because the artstyle is unique and the combat system itself is well balanced and very fun to engage in. The problem is the systems that are supposed to support the combat actively hurt it or are a hinderance. I really hope the developer and publisher don't give up on this game, I'd love to come back to it in a few months and try it out again, hopefully when things are more polished.","0.556422114372253418","1681366751","true","524","1031","0","11","488","0","0","1"

I have played Slay the Spire, and Monster Train through the top ascensions / covenants, as well as a few other card battler roguelikes. I'd say I'm a decent player, but in this game I often feel like winning comes down to luck. Lucky synergy or lucky to not get a boss spawn that disrupts your current build. 

There is also a feature that after you beat a run, the game makes super OP versions of your heroes and sets them as the new boss. In other words, if you do manage to get a really lucky combo or abilities or strong heroes, you are then punished by having to beat even harder versions of them. It is a neat feature on it's surface, but just adds even more to the frustration in practice. 

A big contributing factor to luck is that you cannot refuse card rewards. In the other games, you're actually given currency in lieu of taking a card. Here, If you get crappy rolls, too bad, you're picking one of these cards that does absolutely nothing for your deck.

This game has a lot of charm, and the design is really nice. It's a shame that the balance is way off.","0.536796867847442627","1721965483","false","631","631","0","34","0","15","1","0"

It is has many meticulously crafted mechanics which all have really nice in lore explanations. Acorn folk create armor made of nut shells, snowballs slow your enemies, spicy pepper freaks gain temporary attack buffs. I LOVE the art and concepts behind the mechanics, and this is just one of the 3 tribes. As of this review I haven't even tried the gnome class yet. I love the shademancer class which as it sounds revolves around summoning minions (shades) and sacrificing them for buffs. 

If you are a fan of Slay the Spire, I recomend you try this game, but be aware it is in no way a knockoff of that. All the game mechanics are very original and I am stoked to have another great deckbuilder in my collection.","0","1721931807","true","1030","1519","0","13","484","0","0","0"

This is the best rogue-like deck builder that I've played.

The art and setting are awesome. There's a breadth of mechanisms like snow, ice, spice, and other things that keep the game interesting and allow for a variety of ways to tackle challenges and exploit synergies. It truly is amazing just how every time I play the game, I find a new combo of cards/charms/bells that completely break the game. I don't think any rogue-like I've played has this many exploits just waiting to be discovered, and I still don't think I've found them all after 70 hours.

Surprisingly though, I actually think the game's town where you unlock different cards and shops and charms is actually one of the game's biggest selling points, because it gives the player goals to achieve each run. Like I actually want to keep playing the game and winning things for doing well. That's really cool, and really, the presentation of these rewards in the form of a visible town with characters and shops really helps that (as odd as that seems).

Now, I rarely lose the game due to anything other than my own stupidity. Like a character has smackback and barrage, and so when I attack with one character, my main hero dies and I lose, because I didn't pay close enough attention. Whether that's good or bad will probably vary depending on who's playing the game. I kind of go back and forth on whether or not I like it.

Obviously, good job.","0","1721775483","true","4197","4710","80","12","0","0","0","0"

Everything is polished like a diamond, it looks and feels great and you can tell a lot of care went into it.

I love how original the game is. The charms mechanic (these are my favourites!) lets you tweak card attributes and the bell system adds layers of difficulty similar to slay the spire ascension levels, but more like Hades where you can choose how the game screws you over. I think the game is like Hearthstone but with a roguelite spin. 

My only piece of feedback for the developers: the one thing that bugs me is the lack of notifications for lethal damage. I've lost many runs because I didn’t notice one of my units was going to die. That, at times, can be frustrating. I wish the game took care of the mental gymnastics and allowed me to focus on just the decision making.

Give it a try! It might be a bit confusing the first few runs.... at least it was bit tricky to get into for me, but! once it clicked, it was really fun and easy to understand.  It's SO FUN to play, the art is so good and charming, the music is good to the point where I preorder their LP, the mechanics are really unique and everything is super polished.

Because there isn't, I'm going with 'thumbs up,' but with the heavy caveat that, and I'm not the first to say it, this game is HARD.

To point to it's positives: it's really pretty. This is a fun game to look at, to hear, to hang out with. The presentation is great. It's got some really interesting and fun mechanics. The game play loop is addictive. The unlocks give you a sense of growing power as you play. It's a good time and, as long as you're not super invested in *winning* a lot, I really would recommend it as a standout rouge-like deckbuilder.

However... It's hard. I'd say borderline too hard, but I'm not sure it's borderline. There's *a lot* of things to pay attention to on every turn. I've had what feels like too many losses where I don't even understand what happened. Too many fights feel genuinely unwinnable. I've won twice, but have now faced my previous team about a dozen times and gotten *STOMPED* by it every time. If you don't know, when you win, that team becomes the first phase of the final boss. Except it's not *that* team. It's that team + a ton of buffs and new mobs. I guess it's supposed to be challenging, but it's honestly more just discouraging.

In the end, I do recommend it because it's fun and because, if nothing else, I find myself wanting to come back to it more & more despite how much it tries my patience. I just wish it were a little more forgiving. Like I said, there's a fine line between challenging and discouraging and this game doesn't exactly do a great job of walking that line.

UPDATE: I've gotten this game under my feet a bit more since writing this review and I think that, once you get the hang of it, it's still hard, but not *too hard.* You really have to pay attention and take your time with every turn. And sometimes, there's just no winning. But it's not as punishing as it seems at first.

UPDATE TO THE UPDATE: After spending a couple weeks at the end game, where you 'get' to make things *even harder* for a change to fight a *second* post-boss-fight-boss-fight, without unlocking anything new or being given a single reason to keep going, I'm afraid I have to say I'm back on team 'this game is too hard.' It's also my understanding that they've patched out all the fun and interesting ways to win. It's a shame because it *is* fun and it *is* pretty, but the reward for figuring it out is just... more challenge. I'll probably still play it while I drink my coffee in the morning, but I honestly don't like this game at this point.","0.546759605407714844","1716383168","true","1149","4518","113","7","0","6","1","0"

First things first, this game is HARD. Every move matters. If you are into roguelike deck-builders (like Slay the Spire or Monster Train) then this game is for you. Unlike the others though, each and every decision matters. 

Position your hero in the wrong spot? Die. Restart. 
Gave your companion the shield instead of yourself? Die. Restart.
Didn't see that the enemy hits x2? Die. Restart.
Bought the card that freezes enemies instead of the one that reduces their attack because you find out most of them are resistant to snow? Die. Restart

My win rate  is probably less than 5%. And that's ok.

I really enjoy beating the challenges and thinking of new ways to get to the end. If you want a challenging deckbuilder, this is for you.

Not because there isn't anything to criticize (more on this later) but because of what they criticize: excessive difficulty and RNG. I'm not saying Wildfrost is easy, but I don't buy that it's excessively hard (especially on base difficulty) or impossible to win without high rolling your run.

A few common complaints and why I don't find them convincing:

1. You have to fight your last team and if they were especially strong it's impossible to win

No matter how strong your last team you have a huge advantage they don't: you can play cards. You also know what's coming up and can plan ahead to counter your last leader's abilities. Sure, if you only focus on dealing damage by attacking with characters you can run into a wall, but that's why there are statuses and damage cards. I high rolled a run where I had a character who could attack everything on screen multiple times for huge damage every 2 turns and retaliated when hit and I was still able to win the next run with careful play and deckbuilding.

2. If you don't get good synergies there's no hope.

It's great when everything falls into place perfectly, but there are lots of ways to win fights. You can build a damage engine with a character with lots of small attack, a character with one big attack, retaliation damage and shielding, a few big damage cards, destroying everything in your deck and abusing the recall bell, etc. I've even won runs where I didn't have a good damage engine but I had lots of defense and ways to stall the opposition. No matter what cards you get offered, some of them will be useful, and statuses especially work perfectly fine as complementary pieces. You don't need a 'snow' deck with all the snow-focused characters for snow to be useful. As in most roguelike-deckbuilders it's best not to get too locked in and try to force an archetype, but rather focus on how what you're offered can be used to solve your problems.

So where would I criticize Wildfrost? By the far the biggest issue is readability. There are combat turns where a large number of effects will trigger and you have to calculate everything in your head. Unlike most other games in this genre, Wildfrost does almost nothing to help you understand how things will play out once you play your card, and it's easy to miscalculate. One miscalculation might well end your run too, which can be frustrating. This is a substantial flaw and people complaining about difficulty in this sense have a very good point.

It's also not uncommon to get useless charms (at least for what you currently have), since they are so many and varied. I like that the charm system overall provides a large variety of different ways to upgrade cards (rather than each card having one defined upgrade) and having to play around what you happen to get given is a fun challenge, but it does feel a little bad to get something you simply have no use for, especially late in a run. I think a good change here would be to allow some way to recycle unwanted charms, either by selling them or maybe sacrificing two charms to get another random charm.

Overall though, Wildfrost is a lot of fun and does enough differently from other rogue-like deckbuilders that I can find a place for it despite a few flaws. The graphics and presentation are quite charming as well. I don't think it has the depth and variety of something like Slay the Spire where I'll still be playing hundreds of hours later, but I definitely feel Wildfrost is worth it.","0","1721296182","true","1450","2481","0","20","0","0","0","0"

while it is frustratingly 'difficult.'  i'd say that most of the difficulty is through the lack of QOL for knowing outcomes before they happen...  If you actually take time to plot out every turn you can get through just about anything with good knowledge of how Strategy games or deckbuilders work.  If youve played enough to understand the concepts in these games, you have to incorporate them into every decision.  The game will relentlessly punish if you let it.   The biggest thing is to remember this game has every RPG players least favorite game mechanic.  If the protagonist of a party based game dies, the game ends.  This took a while to get used to after no lifing monster train. 

Everything about the presentation is perfect. While I loved Monster Train very recently it looks like a game running in unity.  Wildfrost does not.  It goes the route of using art design to avoid this and comes across very polished.  

My negatives though: like I mentioned before QOL of changes can explain the difficulty, and is not as big of a deal imo.  Certain things like once you commit to entering the store.  It's a two-step process that slowly pans to two screens.  The first screen traps you into proceeding to the next for no good reason before you can press the back out prompt.  It's really frustrating because the game highlights you next location and my monkey brain always clicks on the shop because it's still considered an available option since items that can still be purchased are inside.  Stupid nitpick, but omg please change this.

Other thing is the 'base decks' feel extremely uninspired.  Basically you just choose whatever generated hero has the most exploitable gimick and build around that.  But, honestly I could not for the life of me tell you the archetypes these heroes are meant to build without the actual cardpool.  Every tribe of heroes has smackback, or heal on kill, or aimless.  And none of these feel like the quintessential playstyle of any of the three tribes, yet are constantly seeded in.  Feels just un fun if I'm being honest and gives me the same feeling as in Slay the Spire when I boss swap for bark or whatever (the double your potion effectiveness).  Could it be good?  Yeah, but it sounds so boring right now.

Another is the hand limit or size.  Maybe it's because I've been playing in windowed but, I have an acheievement for having 12 card in hand.  IDK if there is a hand limit or what but at least 3 times I have drawn a huge hand and It is so overstimulating trying to scroll slowly through 12 or whatever cards because they are all jumbled together.  You're only allowed to play one card per turn and you don't discard until you tell it to which also can use a turn if you don't have a discard saved up.  Which takes like 5 turns to accumulate. Point is the hand size is atrocious to look at for all of these design choices that I otherwise love (in windowed mode).

Otherwise this is honestly growing to be one of my favorite deckbuilders and my journal is plagued with my fallen heroes.  I suck at this game, but if you like deckbuilders and are willing to be patient in every run I cannot recommend this game enough.","0.54356849193572998","1721243530","true","43","1616","2","23","0","3","1","0"

Decided to stop for now, but I might come back, who knows.

Anyways, my first impression being that I would not recommend this game for newcomers (to the roguelite deckbuilder genre). A very careful understanding of the various card mechanics in play (and especially planning ahead) are key here, as a single misplay (and I'm talking misplaying just a single card in most instances) can instantly end your run. Doesn't matter if your other units can easily take out the boss in a turn or two; if your Leader dies, it's game over.

With that said, if you're willing to commit patience and certainly don't rush card plays, your runs can pretty soon result into some satisfying synergies (as any deckbuilder should be). Personally, my first few (failed) runs did feel a tad unforgiving, but the game suddenly felt easier as my knowledge grew and I cleared a run on the 4th attempt.

Additionally, the sound/visual presentation is very pleasing here (even down to details such as [spoiler]bosses going into their second phase[/spoiler] or the sound of the Redraw bell), and a handful of character designs are plain adorable too ([spoiler]Loki[/spoiler] perhaps being my favourite).

In a nutshell, not recommended for deckbuilder newcomers, as single misplays can be run-ending. Players willing to commit to patience however, will be rewarded.

P.S. Having played this on Steam Deck, I was a tad disappointed for lack of touchscreen support. Pretty sure the Switch version (having played its demo over a year back) supports touch controls, but not on Deck?","0","1720961624","true","949","949","0","27","132","0","0","0"

I have one request though: Whether it be a companion or a clunker, I want something that makes it so that junk has Zoomlin when created. Builds that rely on playing junk are way too slow to a point where if you aren't running an absolutely jacked mini mika then the build feels unreliable compared to everything else, which feels unusual for this game, because again, most builds are very maleable and can become good through many different means, but it feels like going the damaging junk route doesnt follow that mindset. Maybe instead just buff the trash mechanic so that created junk has the charms of what created it. I'm not an experienced game designer though, I just know that this feels very slow and vulnerable.","0","1720627653","true","1256","7907","450","3","0","0","0","0"

StS is still the GOAT but there are some fantastic games that sit on the top of the mountain with it at this point. Wildfrost is one of those. I don't know if this has the legs of Slay the Spire but I would argue it's about as well designed and maybe even more fun to play. Tons of build options and useful combos while having a fresh feel to the gameplay. I only started playing since 1.2 so maybe its in peak form right now vs. the past, but I have no idea how this isn't an Overwhelmingly Positive aggregate on Steam. If you are a fan of deckbuilders, this is a must buy. Maybe some recency bias but here is my ranked list for the best of the bests so you can weigh my opinion against your own:

It's basically an instant wipe as unless you can do 18 damage in one hit consistently, you are not coming out of that encounter alive. The idea behind the fight is a good idea, using the 'wild' mechanic, which was underused previously. What 'wild' does is if another 'wild' card gets destroyed, the other 'wild' cards get one more trigger than they usually would, and its a nice mechanic in itself, BUT. Not only is it a permament upgrade for the enemy, as the bonus trigger does not wear off after the card attacks, it STACKS. And this all would be fine if the entire fight would be against enemies that do not have high attack stats and would RELY on the mechanic. However, this is not the case. The big hog, having 18 HP, 5 ATK and SMACKBACK, of all things paired with it gaining the additional triggers from 'wild'? You cannot touch it without having your entire party nearly instantly annihillated. And there's multiple big hogs in the fight. The whole game is well-balanced, but *this?* It's ridiculous. I really love this game, but I cannot recommend it as it is right now, having a death sentence randomly pop up in the middle of the run. My suggestion would be to take the 'smackback' away from the big hog. It would still be a hard fight but you would at LEAST have a window in which you can do damage. Balancing is required.","0.481559216976165771","1720445669","false","994","1205","0","3","0","2","2","4"

Each encounter really tests your game knowledge and decision making but since it's a card game you can take it slow and analyze the board for as long as you need (seriously guys, I see so many players rush when there's literally no timer, slow down and you'll find victory much much more achievable). That being said, the game is very difficult, enemies start to ramp up fast, you can get RNGd charms (I got bread, chucklefish, and scrap in a row while playing shademancers), and they make you learn things the hard way. After beating the game in normal mode a number of times I finally tried the bell challenges and actually beat all the challenges in succession (Berry builds OP). Sadly there's no more challenges after that apart from the daily runs. Overall I'd give it an 8/10, hoping future updates improve the game further by adding more content and making the base difficulty easier while also adding higher difficulty. Oh and the art is hella cute, well done Gazi.

Edit: The updates just bumped this to a 10/10 for me, they basically fixed almost every complaint I had. The game is way easier now but the new difficulty settings make it a challenge that is fair and balanced. The new cards, companions, charms are so cool plus they add the variety that the old version very much lacked. The new enemies really make you think about how to play around them.

The game mechanics are interesting and varied. There is a reasonable number of different enemy types. Each run doesn't take very long to play, if anything a complete run seems a little short.

The frustration mostly comes from the lack of information provided on the basic gameplay mechanics. As is common for modern games there is no in game help and the tooltips leave information out. It took me a few hours of play before I had a grasp of the basics.

The other frustration for me was in playing the two unlocked tribes. The difficulty ramps up a lot. I don't mind the difficulty increase but it became frustrating because your hero is very fragile. So fragile that one hit can easily kill your hero. Not just one hit from a boss, one hit from many different enemy types. Enemies have a lot of abilties and trying to figure out all the interactions Figuring it all out at times felt more like work than play.

Still, it is a fun game to play despite the frustrations.","0","1719440426","true","1700","1744","0","445","0","0","0","0"

Combinations and synergy is how you succeed and there's so many different possibilities to figure out.

Unlike some others here that dislike the game blaming the hero selection or RNG, I haven't had that experience at all.. The game is easily winnable with any kind of hero as long as you upgrade your cards with the charms instead. A good barrage card with snowball and dmg lowering won me the final game (lvl10 bell and vase/bottle) while my hero did near zero dmg and had zero charms. Since everything is kinda limited with none of the cards being offered twice I also didn't experience RNG being as an issue. 

I do however prefer the snowball clan above the other two due to the snowball being extremely powerful and the other two clans having more useless cards to start with. Like with most card and deckbuilding games, less cards is more (controlled loop of the same cards each hand). 

Also I never used the option of putting allies back into my deck to heal them, pretty useless option if you ask me. Especially with some healing options. Well... never... I did do it 3 times to get a different pet.","0","1719945087","true","2417","2429","0","61","0","0","0","0"

The art and music direction are very charming, but the actual gameplay is frustrating swingy; Sometimes you'll breeze through difficult encounters in 3 turns, but other times you'll make a single misplay and get curbstomped by the 1st boss.  This is partially because there's very limited progression other than unlocking new cards & upgrades to find, but also due to so many heroes and cards being overly niche or just straight up bad, leaving you unable to handle some of the enemy gimmicks.  Thankfully the game's fast paced and smooth enough that its relatively painless to spin up another run after you randomly get your teeth kicked in by 30-50 wild boars or punched yourself in the face repeatedly because a crab looked at you funny.

Oh but fair warning, there's an awful mechanic to make your second playthrough harder and it's f**ked my game up so much I've just accepted that I'll never actually beat the game again -> [spoiler] The party you beat the game with replaces the final boss's 1st stage for your second playthrough.  Despite my best efforts I cannot possibly beat the bullshit I stumbled into with my first win, as a perfectly synergetic team that instantly stacks 4 dozen pips of overburn instantly explodes every party combo I've attempted.  This with how much of a crapshoot it is to get a viable team, I'm quickly burning out at this point and am pretty close to just giving up entirely lol.

Pros:
* Cute design
* Fun mechanics

Cons:
* Grindy
* 'Maps' between bosses aren't that long or interesting
* Unlocking more abilities actually makes the game 'harder' 
* Can't abandon a run easily (have to menu > quit to main screen > enter new run > abandon). This should just be a 'quick restart' option
* Lots of other QOL issues
* Possible to get hard stuck because of RNG

[h1]Summary[/h1]
So, I have to say this is a cute game and enjoyable for the first bit. Early on I noticed it was a bit 'grindy' with  its gameplay loop -- to unlock more features (the 'town') you have to complete achievements, which can take a lot of loops, but the maps aren't that interesting and each run can feel very samey, so it feels grindy. It got a little better once I unlocked new 'tribes' (think like new characters in Slay the Spire, that have their own deck archetypes). 

For the downsides though, I'm not a big fan of the choice to make your current deck the new 'boss'. You don't unlock new maps or areas, or new bosses. Just your old deck becomes the new one. Which can also be a huge PITA if you get insane RNG on a run and therefore have to try and beat your old 'luck' run.

This game would really benefit from RNG-proofing. Like allowing rerolls or locking certain items you don't want to see.

You can get some hours out of this game, but I think at 20$ that's an insane price. It might be worth $10. I'd recommend any other deck builders unless this is on deep discount.

And for any of those thinking my 'hours played' doesn't match up with the review -- let me remind you that Steam doesn't distinguish between hours *played* vs hours *idle*. I leave the game open a lot because it's a very idle style game I can play between other things. 

I still don't recommend it generally. It can be an okay time waster but there are way better options. Also the mobile version is less than half the price, so if you really must try it, buy it on mobile.","0.484928786754608154","1718195669","false","1876","6720","0","14","0","2","0","0"

I think Wildfrost is as well balanced as a roguelite deck-builder can be. Even when you get good synergies from RNG the game stays challenging--or maybe tenuous is a better word. You lose immediately if your commander gets taken out, so one bad hand can kill your run. But this constant vulnerability makes a good run feel [i] really [/i] good when it happens.

It took me 42 hours to beat the final, final boss. You have to beat the semi-final boss several times across different runs before you can challenge the 'true' boss. There is enough diversity of enemies and cards to make this repetition tolerable in later runs when the novelty has worn off.

Unfortunatly, I had the main content of the game unlocked and 'finished' after three hours of gameplay, which honestly disappointed me for the prizetag, since replayability isn't really a thing, if there isn't much content to be unlocked, or synergies to be found.
So for me, at the current prizetag, I can not recommend this game, which is unfortunate, it is so promising.

Edit:
I really want this game to work...
It's such a great concept....
I play a run daily, since more than that is not really fun.

Alright, Since I've played a lot of this game and I have almost 100 percented it, i feel inclined to leave my review, so here are my thoughts:

Is this game worth the price? Yes
Is this game brutally difficult? Yes
Is this game like Slay the Spire? No, almost not at all

There is however a huge degree of skill issue. There is a lot to keep track of, knowledge of all synergies are required, and also knowledge of what cards are completely worthless is also required. You will die often because you made a mistake, and single mistakes in this game are devastatingly punishing. You will need to make sacrifices to keep the run alive and you will die and reset often

However, the RNG works in the games favour, you can control it by seeking specific things you need with the knowledge that you gain. Runs start and end very quickly, so a quick brain reset will allow you to move on and onto a better run. Certain encounters will mean doom for specific decks, and you will need to plan around each of them (TAKE SNOWBALLS FOR HOGS DEAR GOD YOU NEED THEM). As it stands right now, town progression is minimal, so replay-ability and progression past achievement hunting is sorely dependent on your enjoyment of the game-play loop. I personally love the game-play loop and the challenge

I wish that cards were better balanced on the player side of things. Some characters are simply too synergistic and very very difficult to pull off, some items are not even worth using, and the Clunker clan or whatever they are called almost always suck to have, the champions are often underpowered and the characters that are unlocked from the progression are also almost always a burden to have on your team, when progression feels like you are actually diluting the pool of cards and heroes available, then you are going to feel bad unlocking them. I will say that most of the encounters do feel very well balanced (MOST, not the hogs, f*** the hogs)


In conclusion, this gets a 8/10 from me. A very solid little indie game that's worth the price, with great art-style and fantastic music, I only hope that the updates continue to improve this hidden gem

Its an unbalanced mess. A new exploit keeps being discovered every week or so, the dificulty is all over the place and really bad at scaling. The art style is adorable but doesnt make up for the mechanics. The cards and character have abilities but you can never tell 100% if the ability is viable because its vague and you will have to look up the clarafication for rules over and over again.  Some cards are over powered while others are crap but since everything relies on rng, you can spend so much time looking for new synergies only to stumble upon an insta death from a randomized storm charm. Its more frustrating than fun and every redeming quality is offset by a bigger downside. You may call it a skill issue but the luck factor is just too prevalant to rely on skills alone. Luck is expected to be a large part of rogue like but I have completed many rogue like and this one is the most reliant on luck when you include the storm charms.  Its a shame because I really wanted to enjoy this game but until they fix the balancing, luck and clarafication of rules, Id play slay the spire instead.","0.478673011064529419","1719269010","false","9046","9346","0","3","0","5","0","0"

1. Controller rumble for character attacks, damage, & game world interactions
2. Co-op mode/feature so 2-4 players can work together to complete the adventure
3. More balanced enemy encounters (i.e. the further the characters progress the more opportunities for more powerful cards, healing, shielding, & card redraws to counter the increasing difficulty of the enemies... or @ least a casual mode with these features)
4. A polished port for Xbox console including items 1-3

Thank you for all your hard work, creativity, & ingenuity in producing this amazing deckbuilding game!

My relationship to Wildfrost is... complicated. To put it into perspective, I was one run away from defeating the final boss, I go to sleep that night and the next morning Wildfrost releases an update which changes the way you gain access to the final boss, so I have to climb all the way over again. I shrug it off, climb my way back to the top... and another update... I grit my teeth climb again, and finally after blood sweat and tears, I beat it. 100% complete, finally I think to myself, finally it's over, I can rest easy and look at that one hundred percent steam achievement score and I will at last know contentment.

As I am writing this review Wildfrost has just released another update... I have gone from 100% to 66% overnight... it is a testament to this game that despite being (I feel) personally targeted by the dev team for the third time, I fully intend to come back and get that 100% achievement score again.

The art style is cute as heck, the ability to name cards means that I can make little in jokes with my friends as we play together over discord, the game play is brutally punishing, as a rule of thumb if you're ever not sure how an interaction will work with different cards and abilities, always assume it will work out in the least favourable way for the player possible. There are many different things to pay attention to and one missed keyword can mean the end of a run.

10/10 It's fantastic, I hate it and I won't let it beat me, I will keep coming back until I either 100% it or I get a hand written letter from the dev team acknowledging their personal vendetta against me.

Update: I have 100% completed the game again! I have reached out to the Dev team for comment but am still waiting to hear back","0.741687417030334473","1717754295","true","5617","6761","4","5","0","33","22","1"

Have been having lots of fun with new builds, stronger builds, getting the new achievements and charms.

If you're new to the game, Wildfrost is a mix between a deckbuilder and an autobattler, though it's not quite either. You have Heroes/Minions/Summons or whatever in two 3-length lanes with countdowns until they attack, and enemies in the opposing lanes doing the same. Each turn counts down with you playing a card that you've added to your deck. During your turn you can also completely rearrange your team's positioning to play around their strengths and incoming attacks. Its a roguelite where you pick-a-path like a simpler Slay the Spire, adding cards or charms to your deck before boss battles.

The charm system is amazing and a lot of fun: charms can be permanently applied either to your summons OR your other cards, as long as every effect on the charm is applicable, allowing for some really creative combinations (up to 3 charms per summon/card, and there's also a specific charm that removes that cap)","0.510309278964996338","1718915489","true","2184","2302","0","52","107","1","0","0"

A beautiful art style, cool world building, a pretty fun gameplay loop (a lot of the criticisms of which, such as the final boss mechanic, are vastly overblown imho), but there is really 1 issue holding me back from recommending it: the UI design is *TERRIBLE.* 

From the beginning I would catch myself idly hovering the mouse around where I intuitively expected a menu button to be, only to have have to consciously look for the button for a second. UI should never be something you have to think about. It's all very pretty, but it's form over function design. 

Take the main menu for example, which takes the form of a gorgeous little village in which all the buildings look very similar. Usually I will just click randomly on houses until I find the one I want because it's too much of a pain to try and distinguish them. On top of that, a lot of these buildings feel kind of unnecessary? Like they wanted to fill out this village with lots of buildings, but they didn't have enough different mechanics, so instead they split up what could have been one part of the menu into several. Like, really, a separate building to see a paragraph of flavor text for 3 tribes? Why is this information not conveyed to me on the screen where I actually pick my tribe?

The second major problem is that the UI does not convey information well enough. Wildfrost is a very mechanically complicated game. There is a kind of confusing order of operations around all the stuff that will happen in a turn. There are a lot of different statuses and effects that can end a run if you don't understand how they will play out. 

I haven't attempted the anything beyond the base difficulty yet, but I have lost quite a few times at this point, and outside of 1 or 2 of those losses, they have ALL been due to simply missing or misunderstanding the way a round of combat will play out. If you miss the little barrage keyword on one of the 6 enemies each with their own effects and statuses on the screen, sorry, you're probably going to lose. 

One particularly baffling choice I've been bitten by, is making both the status that makes a character deal 1 less damage, and the one that makes them *take* double damage, represented slightly different _purple oval shapes_. What were they thinking?! 

Getting your (all brown in the corner of your eye, but mechanically super important) wooden allies mixed up, enemies getting silenced counting as a hit in some situations but not others, affects that can end the run if you forget to move that character into a different row, there are so soooo many points of failure to ruin your game if you don't treat with the gravitas of filling out some important government application.


Although there is a lot to like about this game, if you haven't played monster train, *please* start with that first. It is a very similar formula (rows of characters that you buff then attack eachother in turns), but it is a much better designed game and I rarely ever have had incidents like this these. Wildfrost on the other hand... if you're interested, go for it, but personally, I wouldn't pay more than $8 for it.","0","1718755680","false","2662","3785","0","41","457","2","0","0"

To me the difficulty is in a really good spot right now, though I do see many 'expert' players saying its too easy now.  One thing remains true, a single mistake, or moment of not paying attention to things like barrage, smackback, etc. can and WILL end runs.  I've lost many runs because of this, but I'm okay with that, because I knew it will happen.

I've played StS to death, and I recommend it wholeheartedly.  Still, if pressed to choose, I prefer Wildfrost.

Presentation is often overlooked in favor of mechanics, especially in mechanic-heavy games like deckbuilders. That's not to say that StS has poor presentation; I think it's charming enough, and never had any issues with it. But Wildfrost is on another level when it comes to a cohesive and polished design language. There's so much character in everything: enemies, items, backgrounds, bosses, animations; everything fits this polar tribal aesthetic that's whimsical on a surface level, and a little dark when the ends of runs and the logbook are taken into account.

Actually, now that I think about it, I'd watch a Wildfrost cartoon series.

The music helps the art and animation along beautifully. It's upbeat, bouncy, and inviting. But my favorite thing it does is the shift from slow and moody while making preparations and strategizing at the beginning of a fight, to loud and boisterous once the first blow is landed. It's like it's saying 'Oh, now it's ON!'

Still, if aesthetics were the only good thing going for the game, I'd find it hard to recommend. Luckily, Wildfrost is mechanically deep and interesting, with synergies that don't seem obvious at first.

For example, one of the tribes starts with an ink pot card that silences effects for four turns. Very useful for enemies with scary effects. I picked up an ally that hit for 7 with barrage, but also hit itself and all allies in the row for 5. But since this was an effect, the ink pot cancelled it (and the barrage), allowing the unit to still attack, but without hurting units in the row with it. I stumbled into this by fighting the ink enemies and hitting the one that adds ink when hit. Would have never considered it otherwise.

There are lots of 'A-ha' moments like that (ICBM with smackback, Flamewater with Cake charm, etc etc.) which is a testament to the tightness of the game's design. Your level of patience as you learn the base mechanics will determine how much depth (and enjoyment of said depth) you ultimately get out of Wildfrost.

In fact, my only real complaint with Wildfrost is that some of the unlocks are based around luck. Going five runs without the Naked Gnome spawning, or getting two bosses in without a Mini Mika or Tiny Tyko or Toaster and restarting to try again--these experiences don't feel particularly great. Though it also wouldn't feel special if I were able to guarantee a specific encounter or companion would appear either, so it's understandable.

People who don't like roguelite deckbuilders definitely won't like Wildfrost. It doesn't change the genre into something that'll bring in new fans or anything. This is a crowded genre where even titles that imitate the heavy hitters can find success. That Wildfrost has the vision and confidence to not only interate, but to improve on that formula, is what separates it from the good games and makes it a great game.

I play this game on stream regularly and even though I made mistakes or had bad runs there are always fun ones around the corner when you take the time to figure out how everything works. 

About that though, the game has a steep learning curve and it is quite likely you won't succeed on your first run because you didn't understand something or haven't unlocked something. That doesn't mean however you have to unlock things in order to win or have a good time. Most of the unlocks let you take the game to another level and allow for more creativity between runs to try new things, win in a new way, or find your preferred kind of deck. Going back to the difficulty, the main thing you have to learn to do is pay attention to everything, all the small details, every enemy, thinking ahead a little, and deckbuilding will help with that once you figure out what is good and bad. 

If you were looking for a card game that has many features (buffs/ debuffs, card specific abilities), challenging gameplay (that can be made more challenging), contains several hours of gameplay, PLENTY of playstyles, or with a creative cast of characters this is the game for you. I'd highly recommend this game to any card game enjoyer that is looking for something new and interesting!

Wildfrost has some similar mechanics to Monster Train but it is different enough that you don't think you are playing a clone.

Gameplay is top notch. You cannot just spam all your cards every turn like in many card battlers, you have to plan ahead, not just what you need this turn, but what you need to survive for several turns to come. I exceptionally like the variety in enemy fights. Each one needs a different strategy and each set of enemies have their own theme.

Music, animations, sound effects, art and all that are excellent. 

A run seems short but before you know it an hour has gone by and you are madly clicking the quick restart button. Also pretty easy to get 100% achievements.

Not as good as StS or Monster Train, but pretty close. Definitely worth a purchase at full price and a steal at a sale price.","0.599750161170959473","1718512381","true","5893","5893","0","44","0","6","0","0"

I love roguelites, card battlers and mixtures of the two. I'm giving the game a positive review despite that because I do believe the game has strong redeeming qualities, and isn't a bad game overall. I've played Slay the Spire, and several others that are similar, and unlike some of those this one tends to feel very samey on every run (within each respective tribe). RLs are typically known and loved for their high highs and low lows feeling in runs and this one doesn't meet that in my opinion. I think this game is a fantastic game for first-timers or early to RLCB players, and I don't doubt its the right feel for veterans too, just not this one.

Graphics - 9/10: Beautiful, creative and consistent art-style, system flows very well together
Audio - 9.5/10: I'm not extremely knowledgeable about musical science, but I know the music matches the game and hits the mark well.
Controls - 10/10: Zero issues, game controls well and functions as it should.
UI - 7.5/10: If I were rating this in my first few hours I'd have given it a 5, as there were a few decisions that really irked me UI-wise. After giving it a solid play there are still a few, but I found some that originally did just took adaptation. One that still irritates me is the location of the Frenzy multiplier being located next to the turn timer. I feel like it should be placed beneath the enemies damage amount. Since it makes sense logically to multiply damage by the number of hits. Easier on the eyes that way. 
Experience - 7.5/10: After finishing a few runs to completion I just didn't feel any motivation to keep going and sadly ended up just booting up StS to scratch the itch (maybe I'm still too hooked on that game)
Story - 9/10: RLCBs don't require a lot of story, this one does a good job of giving just the right amount for worldbuilding and doesn't cram anything else down your throat. The end of the run is cleverly done, but I won't spoil anything.

Overall 7.8/10: Too much snow /j

1. Turn visibility to the player in this game is abhorrent compared to others in the genre.
In Slay if I am facing down a 40 damage attack but Ironclad is at 50 health I know I survive. If I reduced the attack of the enemy am intangible etc. Whatever damage is above the monsters head is what I'm taking. So it's not hard to do the mental algebra turn-per-turn.

In Monster train there is an active damage preview showing the player which units will die and take x damage before the player clicks the end turn button.

WAYY too many runs in this game I feel like I lose because an error in mental calculations. Juggling order of operations between potentially 12 units, effects, if x unit dies who'll they hit instead or after, etc. Since Ink removes the Wild keyword from the boar fight does it cancel out their multistrike since they only got that through that keyword to begin with? Only one way to find out and no it doesn't...and I'm dead.

Whereas in Slay you have characters with say like 40+ hp so there is some room for experimentation of game mechanics mid-run without it being outright potentially run-ruining. 'Oh didn't think that worked like that, oh well I took 4 extra damage then I needed to'. Here you are often juggling units in this game with very small single digit HP. Many times literally 1 HP.

You are constantly teetering on the smallest of screws up or misinterpretation of game mechanics or order of operations mistakes to flush a 30+ minute run at any moment and its mentally draining. It's the driving reason behind so many negative reviews and why so many casual players who are captivated by the approachable art-style bounce off this game so quickly. 

If I lose I want it to be because I put myself in a bad position, I should have taken x card, should have gotten more crowns to get my units in play faster, should have taken more munchers to thin out my desk to make it more consistent to protect against bad draws etc.

Game needs a preview turn button or a once per run redo on a turn, idk something. And you can then turn it off via a skull or something if you want the OG experience similar to the injured companions changes.

2. Lack of individual run variability / special events. Slay the spire & monster train between the encounters have some random event rooms that help spruce up the run. These serve an important role of throwing a curveball at the player.
If I'm building towards a deck with x synergies but an event room offers me a special card or item that I don't know when I'll be offered it again, that is engaging to the player. In Slay there are certain artifacts/events I may encounter once every hundred runs and those are the runs I remember.

But at a certain point in this you just end up going through the motions. I think lack of any sort of random events between encounters is a major drawback. Encounters always have a goblin for money, I win, choose a path of 3 rewards and rinse repeat.

Not saying the core gameplay loop isn't fun because it absolutely is, but there needs to be more variability. This could take many shapes, maybe there is a 3rd path sometimes between encounters but its clouded so its a gamble of what you'll get. Random events as I mentioned above, maybe some paths between encounters offer miniboss encounters that offer unique rewards but any unit loss is permanently gone etc. etc. Just something to separate one run from the next besides inherit deck synergy building which is implied as part of the genre itself.

3. More postgame incentive to continue playing, I enjoy runs in this game for their intrinsic value but I think there needs to be something else besides card frames.

4. Charms are too random and variable in usefulness. Straight up. Getting durian / balance charm / multihit can turn a losing run into a booming success. Getting Yank / bread feels like I legitimately got robbed of any reward whatsoever.

I think this game needs internal tiering of charms common, uncommon, rare. And then either have common, uncommon, rare gacha machines. Or you can put x extra money to guarantee a certain level, or have the % chance of common, uncommon, rare show on hover over the machine. I don't know something, hell even an option to sell charms you don't want at the shop. Stop giving me Yank charms.

Obviously all charms can't be winners it would make the game too easy but getting a bad charm early on feels crippling.

5. Navigating the hub world is a pain, buildings are pretty to look at but need signs or icons indicating their functionality.

6. There needs to be a dialog box that pops up informing the player of unequipped charms prior to entering an encounter. I've lost multiple runs to picking up a charm, holding off on equipping it to see what units I get offered in case I want to put it on a new unit and then forgetting it to put it on prior to the encounter. 

7. There needs to be a way for the player to see what charms can go on which of your cards prior to purchase from the charm merchant. Moko charm (+1 frenzy, -1 attack, -1 HP) can't go on Snoffel presumably since it has no attack but there is no way for me to verify this prior to purchase.

8. The fact that Greed attack bonus isn't actively tracked on attack stat for both yourself and enemy units that have greed is straight up dumb as hell.

That all said Art-style is great, vibrant and captivating. Playing the game at its core is enjoyable, sound effects, visuals, and deck building fun is all here and present.
I know people always complain about balance in roguelike deckbuilders but considering its 3 different clans all with their unique synergies against so many bosses. I think its not bad. I never felt like an outright lost an encounter because I didn't have a way around x, I've definitely gone into some fights knowing I had a bad match-up or turn 1 draw but never felt like I outright lost on preview.

I just hope the game is improved more over time and maybe another clan is added.","0.916628658771514893","1715935842","true","1173","2942","0","5","357","125","3","0"

Coming from 100%ing StS I didn't expect a game [i]as peak[/i] and this definitely wasn't. It's cute, charming, and fun, but with 2 major issues that prevent it from truly reaching its full potential.
Obviously this game has less content than StS, but it's in development and being updated so that is not a criticism

The first issue is that the communication to the player is godawful. What charms can be used on who/what, how charms interact, how much damage is being dealt/received are all barely if at all communicated and things like charms overriding each other and cards/characters being unable to gain an attribute again (e.g. giving a +4 but consume to a card with consume already) have to be learned the hard way (likely losing a run). Simple UI changes to reflect this info could massively improve user experience.

Secondly, the balance is very hit or miss. Some builds like shroom and snow are just objectively better than pepper builds, and certain charms or companions are so OP they essentially insta-win the run or guarantee a final boss reach (Wort, Nova, Groff in first 1/2 frozen travellers basically guarantee a good deck). Furthermore, the first 2 tribes just feel sorta better than the clunkmasters, but that may be inexperience. 

Either way, the game is still fun and like most roguelikes leaches my soul through my skull. The art style is extremely cute and I love the names; overall the game has phenomenal presentation. I'd give it a 7.5, but the above changes and new content could easily boost it to an 8.5 or 9","0.523809552192687988","1718242285","true","679","1373","0","44","230","1","0","0"

The Game Design is unique and makes every single turn and decision impactful. The UI is responsive, easy to use, and clear. It's completely bug free, and all abilities function as they should. The achievements are not tedious and drove me to play in the various builds possible to their extremes. Every card has a niche and function in relation to the overall game with no overlap and nothing outright better than the other in all situations. A meta will always exist, but through card customization you can make each build at least win the game even if some are better at it. There is 60 hours of replay-ability I'd guess for myself, and countless for actual card game enthusiasts.
The best thing about this game is the companion card Yuki's snowball actually gets bigger as her damage scales. Fantastic.

Functionality I'd love to see are previews on what adding a charm will do to a card. Thank you.","0","1718241952","true","1070","2205","0","16","72","0","0","0"

Wildfrost is a fun card game. The art is wonderfully drawn and the mechanics run deep. For a game where you can only play one card a turn, it has an intensity to it that is unique. I enjoy the lane system and how deck building is very important to a run. While there are still hard encounters, the game provides you a visual element of the boss/mini-boss you'll be fighting, giving you a slight chance to prepare your deck for the upcoming fight. It's not a perfect system, but random chance can only help so much. 

My initial problem with this game was that once you created a perfect team, the game's boss mechanic would become a problem. For those who haven't finished or wished to remain unspoiled, you can scroll down to the TLDR. Basically, I had a problem where I had literally created a team so good that every run after ended in failure as my perfect team becoming the new final boss lead to an issue where I couldn't beat them. I played a dozen attempts trying to overthrow my old team and I gave up, giving this game a negative review. 

Cut to a year later and I saw this game had an update, I gave it a shot for old time's sake and you know what, they somehow did it. They made the perfect mechanic to beat hard hitting teams, the new ink mechanic fixes my problem exactly. Making a card item, the only things enemies have no direct interaction with, that essentially clears all their effects helps devastate that perfect team. Alongside a bunch of new cards, Wildfrost feels rather complete now and I appreciate that all these cards didn't come from a DLC as I have played a few too many card games that immediately throw new cards into a purchase. I want to thank the devs for going out of their way to bring new life to this game, so I can keep enjoying it.

TLDR: The game is very fun. The Friends & Foes update added a bunch of cards the game needed to feel complete. And I hope it gets larger as I'm ready for more.","0.501564979553222656","1693439827","true","960","2209","0","32","327","0","0","0"

TLDR - This is a top tier card game. Instabuy for fans of the genre. 

All the good I've said below still stands; the charm system is just fantastic game design, the art and characters have wonderful charm (hah), and there's pleeeenty of build variety. Many of the problems I've complained about have been fixed! 0 bell runs now adequately feel like A0 in that they're basically impossible to lose if one plays with a brain. Many cards and charms have been reworked to not be curses (some still are, I've literally never been happy to see the Yank or Gain Damage When Snowed charms) and open up even mooooooore builds! If anything, I feel like the game is a little too easy now even on Overcranked + Eye. Let me crank EVEN HARDER.

I can't understate the build variety I've felt possible. Some things are obviously good, but there's no one true path to victory that must be followed at all times. I've won with obviously good strategies, like instantly applying oil + frost on everything every turn, and one's I previously wrote off as too bad to ever work, like summoner pumping +thorns on everything and poison builds. Slow, turtly builds even work great now with a good engine.

The kind of person who finds joy in that experimentation, finding the broken combos while working under tight requirements and ever changing challenges, Wildfrost nails it and keeps improving. Tickles the brain real good.

--------------------------------------

TLDR - This is a top tier card game in the making. Instabuy for fans of the genre. 

I've beaten Slay The Spire A20 Heart more times than I can count, and after beating the true boss of Wildfrost a few times I'd say it's probably around A10-15 in difficulty. 

The hero/charm system is so much fun. Runs can get so wacky and varied that STS might have a run for it's money down the line. So many fun mechanics to mess around with. Assembling some charmgod card combo is soooo satisfying. Plus so much charm in the cards. One hero gains +damage any time frost is applied to a card, he has a cute lil snowball over his head that gets progressively larger as he gets stronger. The attention to detail is so nice.

I really loved this game, which also means I have pleeeenty to complain about, but only because there's so much potential and I wanna put as many hours into this as I do STS. So really these complaints are on the off chance a dev is reading this and care what randos on steam have to say:

Lot of reviews complain it's too hard. I disagree, but I do think they could've elongated the game by making it easier earlier. STS A0-10 are basically free wins for competent nerds who like card games, but a necessary onramp for people who are learning. Wildfrost starts right around A10. 4 victories and I had seen everything the game had to offer difficulty wise. I would've liked to have had an easier option to see how busted things can get with some of the bad cards, and then optimize from there. Low ascension runs are fun sometimes. 

Most of the difficulty comes from lack of choice. Only 2 routes to choose on the map as opposed to the STS ~3, sometimes the starting hero options suck, frequently the heroes you gain on the run suck, frequently the relics you pick up are actually curses. Maaaaany terrible/trap cards. But also many instagrabs because they're so good. Most of my runs are over before the first boss, but then I basically never die after the 2nd boss. I bet most people complaining that the game is too hard are saying so because they're getting unlucky in the first few runs and thinking the game impossible. I'm not sure what the solution here is, maybe adding 1 more event between encounters in the first area? A way to stabilize a bit before succumbing to the extreme variance, but without streamlining too much is a hard balance to find.

Not necessarily a problem, but I find the deckbuilding to favor much faster decks. Inscryption also played like that, but this game has lots of cards that want you to play a long game. The problem is that boss encounters all outscale you in a prolonged battle. Don't win fast enough and you won't catch up. Fall behind, you won't catch up. Either the cards incentivizing turtling and setting up need to be better, or have enemies scale less quickly. Or maybe reducing the extreme variance will allow tighter deckbuilding so that the longer strategies might work. 

Tying town unlocks to achievements issss rough. I haven't unlocked half of them I don't see myself doing it any time soon. How am I supposed to get 20 poison on an enemy when I'll maaaaybe see a poison card in like 1/5 of my runs, it only applies 1-2 at a time, and either the enemy dies too fast for it to build or will outscale me and one shot me cause I'm wasting my turns trying to activate a bad strategy? Same problem with the shell, or the 100 damage. I tried real hard to go for some of these but assembling Exodia is easier than doing this.

This game is hard.  Perhaps too hard.  It took me perhaps 3-5 hours until my first successful run (edit: and now 9.9 hours for #2!), and what I saw afterwards when I saw who was the new final boss scared the crap out of me.
This game has a bright, colorful presentation that beckons you in, but it's ruthlessly difficult, and takes a while to adapt to if you are coming from other card-based games.  This game does things opposite of what one would intuit from other games: each card played takes one turn, but you can arrange your pieces on the board any way you like at any point without using a turn.  Playing an ally takes a turn, but it took me a while to realize that discarding an ally from the playfield was a free action.
This game is all about tactics, although appearances may lead you to believe that it plays like Slay the Spire (which, let's face it, this owes a lot to), the truth is that so much of the gameplay is about positioning and tactics that you might be better suited coming off of a game like Into the Breach.
Update: I beat it a few more times so far, it's one of those games that starts off impossibly difficult, but gets easier as you unlock more and more powerful cards.  Similar in aspect to Rogue Legacy, although not to that extreme.","0","1700868100","true","443","2076","0","42","374","0","0","0"

Here is my experience with Wildfrost: after a couple of runs working out the mechanics, I was able to get three wins in a row with incredibly broken decks that made the game feel easy... and then no more wins after that, despite trying maybe 20 or so times. I can't have gotten WORSE at the game after playing it longer, can I? ...Can I?

This forced me to confront some of the design decisions the devs have made with this game that I simply do not agree with. I will not say that skill does not matter in this game - it absolutely does, and if you pay attention to the mechanics you may get out of some sticky situations that you otherwise wouldn't have - but after my experiences with Wildfrost I feel any skill expression is FAR overshadowed by the main problem that this game has, which is badly balanced RNG. Throwing RNG at the player does not make a game 'difficult' because RNG does not reward skill, only persistence to even out the odds in a larger sample size - giving the player ways to offset or control that RNG *does* reward skillful decision-making, so Wildfrost's lack of such controls ultimately makes it far more frustrating than fun.

To explain: remember when I said I had a far easier time winning in my earlier runs? That was because I'd unlocked fewer things in the metaprogression, and therefore there were fewer cards in the pool. The synergies in this game require very strict deck building and management to use to the level needed to win a run, so ironically unlocking more things makes you LESS powerful because the RNGods are more likely to offer you cards that in no way synergise with your current setup, thereby losing you the run even if you play well. Seriously, if your first 3 Followers have no synergy with each other or your deck, just throw the run and start over because you're wasting your time otherwise. For a game which pushes you so hard into the 'one more run' mentality, I found it hard to believe that there's no run reset button in the pause menu.

I play a fair few roguelike games, so pondering on Wildfrost's RNG problem has made me think about metaprogression mechanics that other roguelikes - or roguelites, if you prefer - use to offset the problem of an expanding RNG pool:

1. Stat boosts: As you complete runs you gain incremental increases to your stats that make you objectively more powerful than you were in previous runs, so even if you get a no-synergy build you might still be able to struggle through regardless. This has the problem of making randomness obsolete at lower difficulties, but that shouldn't be a problem with sufficient difficulty customisation (like the curse bells). This rewards you for your time investment in the game by giving you straight-up power in exchange.
2. RNG control: Roguelikes may give you the ability to reroll or mulligan a randomly-generated choice, which still preserves the random spirit of roguelikes but helps even out particularly trash RNG. You can even make rerolls a more involved mechanic by rewarding players with the ability to gain more rolls for skillful play, like letting them buy rerolls with the in-game money (better play = more money = more rerolls, if you want them). This rewards you for skill expression as choosing when to use a limited resource necessarily results in meaningful decisions, plus the incentive to get more rerolls is a nice carrot to dangle in front of the player.
3. Risk management: When roguelikes give you the option to make a run harder (which Wildfrost does), they will often also give you some kind of bonus in exchange for the harder run, usually metaprogression currency (which Wildfrost doesn't). This rewards you for trying harder difficulties therefore incentivising you to get better at a rate that you have control over, and ultimately even if you lose the run you'll probably still get more metaprogression goodies than you would've if you hadn't dared so greatly, so even failing feels good.

And that is ultimately my biggest issue with Wildfrost: its metaprogression feels weak and does nothing to offset its core RNG problems. There are exactly THREE fixed options you can make in each run: which Pet you take with you, which deck you start with and which curse bells (difficulty modifiers) you add to the run. EEEVERYTHING else is RNG, meaning that once you understand what all the synergies are, the only incentive to keep playing is hoping against hope that each time you start a new run the stars will align and Wildfrost's RNGesus will finally see fit to let you pick the cards you need to have an actually good deck.

I'm fine with games that are about grind, but only when that grind respects my time and investment by 1. giving me meaningful progression, 2. allows me to properly express the skills I've learned while playing and 3. gives me the confidence to play at higher difficulties even when I fail. Wildfrost only sometimes delivers on 2 and completely fails at 1 and 3 for me. It kept me entertained for a while, but I just don't see myself coming back to this game like I do some of my other beloved roguelikes. While putting new twists on genre formulae is by all means one of the reasons I love indie games, I feel that in this particular case the lack of features that are standard to metaprogression roguelikes like those I've listed above are very much to Wildfrost's detriment - which is a shame, given how pretty and professionally made the game obviously is.","0.670610904693603516","1717990687","false","781","781","0","40","0","62","11","0"

Since then, a lot has changed from what I last remember, for the better.

Let me get this out of the way: DO NOT ASSUME THAT THE CUTE ARTSTYLE MEANS IT'S AN EASY GAME! It's not as insanely difficult as it was at launch, but the game will test your ability to keep track of multiple moving parts at once, and your ability to plan ahead. Even the champion selection screen will try to trick you, as their stats and abilities are completely randomized. This is the first card-based roguelite I've played that doesn't utilize an energy system at all, instead just going 'one card = one turn'. While it does greatly simplify the gameplay, it only emphasizes that one bad play can instantly end your run.

Still, if you came here mainly for the cute visuals and amazing music, then you definitely won't be disappointed. I do wish there was more storytelling, since they give you little lore bits at the beginning for worldbuilding, and that's it. There are a lot of unlockables, some of them tied to difficult self-challenges, so completionists might spend a lot of time trying to get the perfect run. Overall, it's a fun but very challenging game, and I would recommend this game if you've played a lot of other deckbuilders, like Slay the Spire or Monster Train.

I beat the game in overcranked 22 (but without the vase ....) so i think i played enough to give an honest review and I have few complains :

- As the top comment said, there should be some kind of calculator saying who's going to face what. So many runs have been lost because of miscalculations. You could tell me 'git gud' or 'pay more attention' but here's the thing : in overcranked 22 the game is really difficult. So difficult that, as any roguelite deckbuilding, only few combination of event/cards/heroes will work meaning you will fail a lot of course, but that's why you should not go through a heavy mental gymnastic of calculation during the fight. I want to play a deckbuilding game with awesome art, not spend 15minutes calculating how two smackback eventually with barrage and overburn facing eachother will end-up

- the combinations for victory (at overcranked level) are not varied enough and the heroes / card you will get in the 2 / 3 first bosses are too important. if you chose a overburn heroes, then you only get to chose sarifice heroes, and then on the third heroe you get .... I don't know, block heroes, you are done ; chances to beat the secodn mini-boss or first boss are close to nothing

While this is normal for a roguelite deckbuilding game, it is why the fighting mechanic should allo playing faster so that at least the first 2 fights are not a complete chore to play","0.519230782985687256","1705612782","true","1112","4164","0","17","0","1","0","0"

Theres fun to be had and it looks cool, but its literally the same thing every single run after you play for a little bit. There needs to be more cohesion between the characters and the keychains and cards. It feels like theres not enough there to make it completely unique every time. Also they need to add in more enemies. The boss being the same every time after you merk ur old team is beat.

And yeah it feels like its copying STS really hard without adding a lot of what made that satisfying every run. There should be more depth, more to unlock, more tribes, more effects, unlockables that feel cool and change the gameplay. It feels like they put up cheap goals to try and extend the very little work they did to make a game. Part of the big reason im tired of roguetype games is that they stretch out a very little amount of content and it becomes repetitive fast.

MY TURN CANNOT END UNTIL IVE PLAYED THE CROWNED CARD. I have no choice but to end tthe run as the game doesn't recognise im softlocked and prompts me to end the turn, like other situations do.

the recent update (1.2.0) fixed its most major flaws which were lack of encounters, cards, and companions. this point in particular is important for deckbuilders/roguelites, and I think the game is now in a good state. it could still do with more encounters especially, but overall I'm confident leaving a positive review. it's a genuinely good turn-based strategy game among the likes of slay the spire. but to be clear, it's a different kind of game that focuses more on positioning and strategy over deckbuilding

my only complaint is the metaprogression. it's something that has bothered me in similar games (monster train, slay the spire, etc.) due to the required time commitment and how much more difficult or frustrating it tends to be to play without unlocks. i.e. I don't think this level of metaprogression fits strategy games","0","1717863986","true","2676","4379","0","4","322","1","0","0"

1. Content galore! Since its launch, Wildfrost has blossomed with an abundance of new cards, enemies, charms, and more. It's like a treasure trove that keeps on giving.
2. Balance perfected. With the 1.2 update, the game has achieved a sweet spot in difficulty, making it not only more accessible for newcomers to the genre but also a refreshing challenge for seasoned players. Plus, for those seeking an extra thrill, they've even included options to ramp up the difficulty.

Overall, Wildfrost has transformed into a captivating experience that's bound to keep you hooked for hours on end. Kudos to the developers for their dedication to improving an already promising game!","0.461979866027832031","1684594281","true","424","888","0","29","100","0","0","0"

Pretty fun so far, so I will be trying out the new tribes, difficulty modes and challenges. Its your typical roguelike deckbuilder, with some nice animations and gameplay veriations.

I always want to get >1h of gametime per € spend. Because of sale I hope to get at least 10 more hours of fun out of this, I will adjust the review accordingly.

So far: 8/10.

Edit 1: 6,5h in. Now won the game with all 3 classes. Its a fun but punishing mechanic that your previous win becomes the new boss to beat. As my 1st win was OP, my 2nd win became that much harder. I wonder if the game has much replayability now that i've beaten it with all 3 classes.

Edit 2: After 15 hours im done with this game. I tried unlocking as much new things as possible to keep it replayable. Some frustrating things: you unlock stuff in order, and some unlocks force you to play a specific class or build. If you dont do that, you wont unlock more content (1 by 1). This makes the grind very boring and the rewards feel very bad for the amount of time and effort put in. Replayability is not that great, and I felt the most fun was in the first 6 hours, and it was downhill after that.

Overall score: 7/10, decent roguelike deckbuilder but don't expect to much depth or replayability.","0","1717502750","true","100","915","0","280","387","0","0","0"

It's easier and deeper than ever. This game should also be commended just for trying something different in a derivative genre. The fact that it kills what it's going for makes WF a must play if you like deckbuilders and can deal with some Ls along the way to 'getting it.'  

Yes, this is a challenging game, but it's not Dark Souls. Much of the difficulty stems from the game's unique approach to digital deckbuilders. Mainly this means the counter system, which basically is a number that ticks down on each card every turn. Once it ticks down to 0, damage and effects are dealt. This makes the game about tactical and strategic timing. This is hard to wrap your head around at first and you'll make frustrating misreads, but once it clicks you're in for truly original card battling.

The planning and executing of a big turn or clutch play in this system feels like perfectly running the clockwork motions of a heist. When the plan falls apart it can be annoying, the information may seem to hard to read, but it's in the moments that everything comes together, the theorycrafting, comboing, etc. that you realize how Wildfrost is just as genius as it makes you feel.","0.476591289043426514","1717733241","true","741","1193","0","11","0","1","0","0"

After ~8 hours, I have 2 wins, yet by the achievement percentages less than 1% of players have a win with the base tribe. That being said, if you're looking for an entirely casual deck building experience, this isn't really it.

A lot of the reviews bemoan the game's difficulty, which is understandable to an extent. My first 3 near wins (but ultimately failures) I lost most likely due to a failure in my mental calculations because I was playing the game too quickly. Despite this, I disagree with the opinion that the game has too little turn visibility. To an extent, damage previews can rob a game of the fun casual feel that appeals to some players, and I think the same would be true with Wildfrost. The game might be significantly more painful if you could immediately see the outcome of every permutation of your team on the field, as it would create a lot of overhead where you check all 6 slots on the board every turn in some cases.","0.520547926425933838","1717714334","true","462","2359","0","45","309","1","0","0"

outside of being hacky, this kind of thing is infuriating in a deckbuilding card game with whats supposed to be perfect information.  It's as if you're playing risk, finally take ukraine, and your opponent goes WHOOPS I had 40 troops under the table, and you're like no dude that's not the rules and he's like well my house my rules, just stop playing then.

Most of these games tend to overcomplicate themselves to build on Slay the Spire, but Wildfrost is built off a huge list of very simple rules. It's design is elegant, and the way the music starts slow and picks up as first blood is drawn brings a chill down my spine.

It's the kind of game where the way you play your deck matters. I've clawed myself back from fights I've been CONVINCED were unwinnable and those are some of my fondest memories in any game. Most turns it's pretty obvious what to do, but if you want a game that rewards you for really puzzling over what to do, this one's for you.

While it's individual simple, it is a complex set of mechanics that interconnect. I think that's awesome. But, if you're new to the genre, this game is unforgiving with miscalculations. I've seen a lot more punishing games but I wouldn't blame you for starting with the basics.

I'll start with the obvious, but this game is one of the most aesthetic I have ever seen. The art-style, the cards, the characters design, the UI, the animations, etc. : everything is so gorgeous it's painful to look at any other game now that the bar is so high.

Somehow after years and years of studios developing card games, they still designed a completely original combat system that works quite well.

If there was a 'Wait And See' option instead of Yes or No this review would be it. At full price and in it's current state I can't recommend it.

This game is fun and has heart, but it seems to have been playtested only by people who were intimately familiar with the game. It is unfairly punishing of small mistakes, and there are very few of the quality of life features that StS has and Monster Train have. If the current difficulty is a hard requirement then skip the first two fights so there's less repetition and runs are at least faster. 

I will change this review in a heartbeat and recommend it to everyone I know if some QoL features are put in. At the very least, display somewhere in-game what potential fights are on which floor so there's less burden of knowledge (the last boss is previewed, why not each floor?), and add a predicted damage feature like Monster Train so players can see if their next move unwittingly kills them.","0.480314940214157104","1682865657","true","574","1423","0","142","751","0","0","0"

It's a solid 8/10 to 9/10 now for me, definitely enjoyed the new content and put in a lot of time even after I 100% it to go for streaks. Glad they took some of the more offensive RNG elements out! 

Having beaten the ‘game’ (rather, what I assume is the most difficult settings since I got the special achievement for it), I can safely say this is a pretty solid 7/10 deckbuilding roguelite with some seriously questionable design choices. I’ll probably play it for a bit more to 100% it, then be done with it. That’s the long and the short of it but I gotta state my misgivings for anyone thinking of a purchase. I’d say the game is PROBABLY worth 20 bucks, maybe. 

The basic game is a slight twist on the standard ‘line of guys you fight with cards’ deck-building format. It’s a bit more like Monster Train than Slay the Spire, and clearly designed around having a very short, tight experience. A standard game might run you 40 minutes tops.

There’s not a lot of content. Some might call this ‘streamlining’ compared to say, The Binding of Isaac, but personally I found that lack of content quite discouraging. There are, no exaggeration, maybe a dozen or so different encounters in the game. The variation comes not in the battles you fight (which are more like puzzles than anything), but in what tools the games gives you to fight those battles. And the selection of those tools is also pretty small. The variability can also be quite high- the difference between a good card and a bad card, or a good charm or a bad charm, is absolutely enormous. There were many times I won and it didn’t really feel earned- I had just gotten lucky and pulled the best cards/charms from the small pool available. On the flip side, there were definitely games I won because I had to play smart, and playing on the knife’s edge of defeat is a great place to be. In those moments the game is a 10/10. 

However, there’s one absolutely terrible mechanic that has a snowball effect for the rest of the game. Bear with me because this will seem kind of pedantic. There’s not a lot of RNG in the game and even drawing cards can be made more consistent through various mechanics, but there’s a card ability called ‘aimless’ which randomizes which target an enemy (or your own cards) can attack. More than once I lost games where there was no reasonable counterplay to an aimless enemy sniping an important card, and there’s one particular encounter that forces aimless on all your cards, and you can just lose the game right off the bad if the RNG decides to send your attackers into the wrong unit. That’s bad and terrible and not fun at all, but not really a horrible sin. The real problem is that because aimless exists, you get no help when evaluating turns- you have to do all the predictions and math yourself. If you’ve played Monster Train, you know how unplayable the game would be if it didn’t show you the outcomes of turns before you make them. This is that on a smaller scale. It’s incredibly, INCREDIBLY easy to make a very small mistake and then have your game end in seconds because you neglected to account for one small thing. Some might call that a skill issue, and indeed the burden is on the player to correctly account for every eventuality. I was able to put up with it but I can easily see someone losing a game they were otherwise having fun with because they didn’t notice a -1 modifier on their card or they forgot what modifiers carry over when a mushroom splits, and then uninstalling right then and there.

Overall Wildfrost is a fun, albeit flawed game. Some decision decisions are baffling (why are there all these buildings that show you like, 3 to 6 things you’ve unlocked each? Why aren’t they all on the same screen?) and some are downright bad (why is there a boss that can randomly nuke your entire board?) but I’d say there’s more good than bad in there, and winning consistently is definitely possible (I got a streak of 5 just trying to unlock stuff). I’d understand if you played for a few hours and thought differently, though.

It is easily one of the top deckbuilder rogueliked out there with Slay the Spire and a few others.

Like other great games it requires the player to learn the mechanics. In that case the main point is to pay attention to each character's and enemy's number before acting and think ahead.

The difficulty is just good and actually quickly get very easy if you grasp the concept well.

Do not get frightened by the supposed difficulty peak sometimes mentioned.
The game gives sooo many opportunities to create monstruous strategies that you can almost always be far above the level of the enemies.
A 100% win rate is very easy on base difficulty.

Now if you like challenge, there is a lot.
You can add cursed bells that will strengthen enemies or weaken you in several ways.

The devs are amazing, they listen to the players, just enough, added already a lot of content to the game...

And last but not least, it looks charming, the art is full if life and the music excellent.

Speaking of fairness; the game is fair and transparent. You're able to view every course of action before locking in, and while RNG is present, the majority of it is optional on your end to take, or given to enemies alongside ways for you to counter or control it. That being said, it's a very difficult game. However, if you know what you're doing, every run is winnable. It's a challenging but rewarding game to punch up against and struggle to get your strategies to work. If you just want a game that pats you on the back and rewards you for playing, this isn't you. 

HOWEVER, if you're someone that actually plays games to enjoy the thrill of strategy, challenge, or theorycrafting? It's a phenomenal game. You'll notice that I only have twenty hours in the game, but I don't consider it a bad thing. There's a lot of games out there to spend time on and play. Personally, once I 'solve' a game and figure out how to reliably win, I start losing interest fast and move on to the next one. If I were to make any critique of the game it would be that there's not enough enemy variety (though the update may have fixed that.) I see a lot of people giving the game criticism because the default final boss gets stronger based on what you used on your last run; personally, my problem is that the 'true' end removes that boss, and I would actually *PREFER* having to encounter a progressively more difficult/different boss each run. Y'all are wimps.

Also, its only 20 dollars. Not only does it fit the criteria for time spent to money spent ratio, but it's also time spent WELL. Even if it was a 40 dollar game, I wouldn't have given a negative review.","0.675666272640228271","1717546094","true","1207","2246","0","6","0","15","2","0"

The new update just blows me away, it's perfect, you should give this a try if you like card games.

To address some of the top negative reviews:
- Card drafts are OPTIONAL and unlike other rogue-likes you only get drafts at designated points instead of at the end of every fight. The muncher event removes up to two cards, and you get plenty of crowns which lets you designate cards you'd like to be played before the game even starts. This is valuable because turns end whenever you play a card instead of when you run out of mana.
- THE DIFFICULTY IS ALRIGHT. It's the same ascension system that Slay the Spire has just opt-in for each specific modifier like Hades's Heat system.
- THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGES YOU HAVE OVER YOUR POSSESSED DECK. If you're not aware already, the deck you used to beat a run becomes the final encounter on your next attempt should you reach the peak. Even if it was powerful, the enemy AI is unable to shuffle positions like you can to decide who gets hit first in the next exchange, you can maneuver and remove a critical part of their synergy, and they only have access to your CHARACTERS and charms, not the triple +7 damage target entire lane bomb you've scrapped together.","0.490373045206069946","1715713503","true","386","2240","0","20","0","1","0","0"

The game presents itself fairly well between the art style and music, with a simple but understandable basis to the world lore. Some of the enemy design is quite random, such as encountering flaming monkey enemies in a frozen cave, but overall the world is fun to experience. The game is somewhat lacking in immersion however. Its various screens and sequences are not very connected or interwoven, due to the absence of environmental backgrounds along with the bland world map. It actively feels like playing a game that is just cycling through different layouts, rather than a journey which is progressing.

The actual combat is quite satisfying and presents a variety of tactical mechanics from choosing and swapping unit positions, playing cards, customizing cards with charms and acquiring new cards throughout the course of a run. The different mechanics and general flow of the game are very comprehensive and easy to settle down in. While there is some randomness to starting a run, building a deck and drawing cards the game does a fairly decent job of allowing the player to adapt and improvise without needing a huge amount of luck; although exceptionally unfortunate situations can still occur. Players can be heavily punished for missing even a single detail each turn, requiring them to pay constant attention. While this does make the game very engaging it can also be frustrating when mistakes occur. 

A solid amount of variety is present between the different cards, charms and combat mechanics. There are quite a few achievements and unlockables, as well as some added difficulty settings, which together helps give it some more longevity. The unlocks are also not hugely expansive but that is somewhat negligible considering how large the default card and charm pools are.

The difficulty balancing is precarious and variable at times, especially in the higher difficulty tiers, but it mostly retains a certain amount of consistency. There are moments where players acquire niche charms that are not very useful, or may be faced with an enemy type that their deck is disadvantaged against, but these moments are not especially pervasive. The single most glaring issue with the game balance is the ultimate final boss fight, which is just so extremely overbearing and restrictive that none but the most ideal builds can mathematically survive against it.


While the difficulty of this game is at times downright unfair it does present a strong tactical experience wrapped in a fun if not superficial world, which overall makes up for the otherwise frustrating moments.

You can immediately build and feel the effects of your choices and builds as soon as you hit the word go. The game has a great variety not only in enemy types and player factions, but also in individual playstyles within those factions. 

I personally love playing the shade faction of two of their faction options: Burn (which allows you to place an explosion counter on an enemy, and when their health equals the counter number they explode damaging anything in the row with them) and Summon decks (summon a large number of varied allies and place them strategically on the field without suffering the normal loses of losing a party member in matches). But even then, that faction on its own still has a handful of other options for players willing to try them out.

The game feels unique both in its art stlye and approach to gameplay, giving the players as many paths to victory as they could want on their journey to find the Sun.

Its not difficult you just have to have all the cards that are good together which 90% of the time your not getting or you'll have a mess and lose meaning you'll barely make it to the next fight and get wiped. Seems like everyone is saying on cards that are good are just snow, frenzy, and some other one. Implementing rerolls or just buffing leader without charms or trinkets cause god damn is the leader mad useless half the time a sitting duck that is usually to slow to do anything. Enemies are kind over loaded you have a minimum of 3 and you fight waves of 4 to 6 if you cant burst them its game over. Effects that just blow healing, Aimless, and fury are the worst effect. healing is to low and slow extra healing on full heath should increase health. Fury doesn't work unless the character is alone that is very bad 9 times out of 10 you get bodied. Poison is meh acorn shield should not effect it but it does why? Overload is so cool but not when the boss has 30 to 40 hp vs your 1 attack and applies 3 overload. EVERYONE RUNS SNOW SPICY FRENZY!!!! Boring.

Think Monster Train or Slay the Spire, but with a breathtaking art style inspired by global indigenous cultures.  The first tribe you encounter has a strong Inuit vibe, for instance, and the game's mechanics are cleverly woven into a natural world theme – acorns bolster your defenses, mushrooms unleash poisonous attacks, and so on.

Everything about Wildfrost is a visual and thematic treat.  However, don't let the beauty fool you – this game packs a serious punch! I'm three hours in, and the difficulty is no joke. While I adore everything this game throws at me, I'm a little unsure how far my skills will take me

Here's the thing: even if Wildfrost ends up kicking my butt repeatedly, the experience itself is simply stunning. If you're looking for a visually captivating card battler with a unique thematic twist and a challenge to match, Wildfrost is definitely worth checking out. Just be prepared for a wild ride (pun intended)!","0","1715247990","true","164","164","0","47","882","1","0","0"

    [*]This is the [b]best[/b] roguelike deckbuilder if you enjoy positioning units.  Similar to Monster Train, but better, because you can freely move all units on the board each turn!
    [*]Crown system allows some control over starting hand, and those cards are free.  Imagine having multiple champions from Monster Train and being able to choose which cards are champions.
    [*]Three tribes.
    [*]Both aggressive and controlling strategies are viable.
    [*]Game mechanics are interesting, challenging, fun, and fair.
    [*]Ascension system with 10+ levels allows you to control the difficulty.
    [*]Cute art. Good animations and music.

    [*]Some cards/units are much better than others, which can limit run variety.

Like most games in this genre, you'll be attempting runs where you're faced with increasingly difficult fights, building decks of cards as you go, and unlocking new cards as you play. I think the most unique aspect of the gameplay is that there is no 'energy' or 'mana' cost to play cards. This is effectively replaced by timers on your cards and your enemies. Every card you play counts down those timers and when they reach zero, the card will attack, so you'll need to think carefully about what to play when. It takes a little bit of time to get used to this wrinkle but it's a great change from what I was used to as someone who plays a lot of games in this genre. I was also very surprised by the endgame which really forces you to consider how you're building your deck and its strengths and weaknesses. Couple this with strong aesthetic, music, and a goofy sense of humor, and this one is definitely a recommend from me.","0.5071868896484375","1714341440","true","1093","1372","0","73","0","1","0","0"

Bad Its funny, because within my first 5-6 hours I talked fairly high of this game.  But you quickly start dreading the thought of winning a game with a super OP deck, knowing that the 50 runs after that are going to be boring as hell, trying to beat this 'Unbeatable' deck at the end of the run. 

After you beat the game the first time, it basically becomes incredible unfun for most people. It just turns the difficulty up by like 10 times.  And you have to fight your previous deck at the end of the run. Which lets be fair - Its a deckbuilder. So high chance its a busted build. 

This is such a stupid thing. In games like these, you usually only get so far because you had a busted deck the previous run. And try beating that... This really makes the game so incredible hard to win a run on.  And losing most of your runs is fun in slay the spire, after you cranked up the difficulty yourself. But in wildfrost you got no choice. 

You can tell quite early in the game, if things have not come together yet - that you are just fudged for this run. Fun.

Not my kind of fun honestly. Might give it another 2 hours see if I change my mind

Not fulfill that urge to 100% a metroidvania, not that burning inside of you telling you to speedrun a level as fast and efficiently as possible, but to just... enjoy playing it?
ahem, well, Wildfrost can help you do that, among other things. It is an insanely well-designed deckbuilder with gorgeous art and incredible soundtrack and sound design that is filled with interesting mechanics that interact in funny ways, all wrapped in a nice package and set in an incredibly immersive piece of world-building, i'd genuinely read a book about the lore of this game if it had more things to go off of.

Yet, at the same time, Wildfrost doesn't feel like it tries too hard or does too much of something - it's exactly what it needs to be - a cute, yet brutal roguelike. Cozy, yet stressful at the same time. Not to mention that it is filled with bits of humor, whether it's through the implications of what the card effects mean, the funny character designs, or fun easter eggs (would YOU spare a naked gnome?). 

It also does not take away fun interactions for the sake of 'balance'. 
If you want to use Shade Clay (an item that copies another item when played and consumes (removes itself from your deck for the rest battle)) on another Shade Clay that's been enhanced with Noomlin (a trait which makes a card not end your turn when played) and a Boonfire Charm (an upgrade which adds 'Apply 2 Overburn to all enemies when consumed', where Overburn is a status effect that explodes all enemies in the row when the health of the enemy it is applied to is less than the stacks of Overburn it has) for an infinite combo, you can do it!
Do you wanna enhance Tiny Tyko, a unit that gains Frenzy (a status that makes the unit trigger as many times as it has stacks of Frenzy instead of just once) when hit with a Lumin Ring Charm (an upgrade that adds +1 to all effect stacks) and have him completely obliterate the entire board? You can do that too! Just be sure to not let him die.
I don't write reviews often so i kinda forgot where i was going with this but uhh yeah i recommend this game my only issues with it are blood bell which is not fun to play against and one spoiler thing (i don't know how to mark spoilers on steam reviews so)

- The art and humour is still fantastic.
- The base difficulty has been greatly reduced and some of the effects that made it so hard are now available as optional settings for those who enjoyed it.
- Combat encounters have been rebalanced to be slightly less overwhelming.
- You're starting character selection has been expanded and seems to have more varied options as well.
- Bosses are now visible on the map before their encounter so you can prepare ahead of time instead of being blindsided.

All around, I can now say with confidence that this game has lived up to all expectations. It's a fun time. I'll leave the old review down below if anyone wanted to see it for some reason.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[strike] Love the style, writing, and flavour of this game. Hate the gameplay. I have tried to enjoy it. But I'm 13 Hours in and I've only managed to reach the final stage ONCE. Maybe I'm just bad. But the sheer amount of luck required for a successful run is agonising. 
- Having your starter character semi-randomised is fun but extremely inconsistent. You're more likely to just restart the game over and over until you find a decent starter.
- Your 'starter deck' is practically non-existent. If you want to build off of any of the abilities your starter character has, you just have to pray that you find the right cards and allies. Otherwise, they're just a glorified health bar that takes up space and occasionally does damage (if they're even able to).
- Combat encounters are entertaining and puzzle like but vary WILDLY in difficulty.
- Since you never know which boss you might be facing before entering combat, sometimes your build is completely countered and you don't receive enough cards in a single run to alter your playstyle on the fly. You also can't try building a deck that covers all possibilities since some bosses are just straight DPS checks that crush you if you don't dedicate your build in one direction.

[H2]Visually appealing but that's about it[/h2]
I don't hate the game.

I hate the balance. It's irritating and not rewarding in the slightest. 

Progression is slow and often times non-existent. 

Games like Slay the spire, at the very least had the ability for you to make progress with powerful upgrades and artefacts, but a game like this is terrible in it's current state with the way you're faced off against increasingly impossible fights. That have a specific solution to solving the turn based combat. 

Get a good start? Awesome, now roll a dice to see which cards you get out of the ones you have available. What? None of them are useful with your current deck? Oh well, make due with them I suppose, because you are forced to take one. That's roguelike and that's fine, but the battles you are put up against are unbalanced. Since one deck you face could be a debuff, or shield, poison, damage deck. You have no way of knowing prior to effectively set up a deck to counter it. If you get the right deck, you're good and it isn't much of an issue. But it is a big issue when it's this punishing, while masquerading as a vibrant cute little game. 

5 hours in and it feels like the game has a stranglehold on me, forcing me to go for unlocks, rather than winning with the base decks / non-upgrades and unlocks.

Sure it's difficult but I don't see how that's a bad thing it just motivates you to keep learning and get better, and I'd also argue it's not *that* much harder than others games in the genre like Slay the Spire.

And for those clowns in the reviews that are crying because 'omg if my leader dies I lose the game' mf have you ever heard of chess? If chess can thrive for centuries it's probably not such a bad mechanic.

But in all seriousness the fact you have to play around your leader is really fun and adds another interesting layer of strategy to the game and the placement of all your units I honestly think it's a great mechanic. People just get caught not paying enough attention to their leader (which will probably happen to everyone at first) but instead of learning from it they just cry and blame the game in the reviews which is a big shame.","0.473684221506118774","1712670111","true","302","1265","0","22","0","0","1","0"

The music is a straight BOP. I HIGHLY recommend the Soundtrack. It's six bucks. It's hypnotic. Once the music kicks in, you get lost in the vibes.

Art? I really adore the art style. It REALY reminds me of Adventure Time, not just that some characters look like Finn but the general design of even some objects.

There is a MIGHTY steep difficulty curve. Some runs, you'll hit a wall and go, 'yep, this is it.' That'll be a LOT of your runs will be like that. Some bosses are basically cheese/durability checks in that they're so annoying to deal with. You need to be aware that they exist when planning synergies. Other's you straight up cook the most extravagant meals. You'll go in with a character you didn't expect much of and pick up the right companions to start making waves. It's especially kino when you find your cheese strat and kinda just win more through out the game.

First, it's objectively the best looking game, that's irrefutable - just look at the screenshots. The bright, charming visuals and simplicity of mechanics and UI appeals to new-comers, while the gentle difficulty scaling keeps more hardcore players engaged.

Some criticise the difficulty which makes no sense because all the top players reach the end consistently. Others criticise the lack of card and enemy/stage variety. I'd say this is true compared to others but I think the game intentionally puts constraints on itself, chooses to play within a smaller sandpit, but does it incredibly well, which in turn actually helps its consistency because it's impressively balanced. 

In one word, the game is 'elegant', which in my mind is the highest of praises as someone who appreciates well thought-out design. Wildfrost is the champion of the genre to-date. 

That said, if the dev(s) 1.5x the variety whilst maintaining its elegance (which is an exponentially difficult feat!), it would have probably helped it achieve the popularity the likes of the other deckbuilders.","0.48310813307762146","1712277018","true","2311","2572","0","1","0","1","0","0"

The difficulty is brutal and its mixed with RNG. I don't mind hard games and I enjoy climbing ascension type systems but there are too many things that just can kill a run.

There are trinkets that you attach to cards to give them bonuses and not all trinkets are created equal. A lot of times you are given these randomly, nothing feels worse then having 2-3 trinkets you can't really use/take advantage of they just sit there.

It's hard to plan for later fights since you only get 2-3 nodes before you are thrown into an encounter and you may have a deck that can do fine against one encounter but you'll get stomped by another. 'just build a deck thats good against whatever encounter you come across'. Ok, I try that. But in my last run for example I was playing the gnome race and picked a hero with aimless. So I have a 6 health gnome that attacks random targets, I'm going through the game fine enough until I run into the thorns encounter. Unlike the first faction, gnomes don't have a ton of 'protection' type cards. So I just prayed everytime my hero attacked that it didn't end my run. Thats not difficulty thats complete RNG. The same thing can happen if a bad target gets hazed (attack random target).

And if the stars do align for you and you build a really cool/strong deck, make it to the last boss and beat it. Well congrats now you just make a new last boss, there are times I'm halfway through a run and I just feel like abandoning it simply because my deck isn't high rolling as hard as the run where I beat it and I doubt I can beat the last boss.

So while I respect the devs vision and do think this is a cool game, I can't really recommend it. Unless you are the kind of player who both enjoys brutal difficulty and a healthy dose of RNG. For me its more frustrating then fun.","0.496736526489257813","1711506836","false","613","618","0","67","245","5","1","0"

The turn and charm systems seem straight-forward but once you get into it there's a lot of complexity and innovation there. I'd put this game up there with Slay the Spire in terms of how much fun I've had with it.

My major gripe with this game is that deck optimisation is SO HARD. So much of your build depends on luck of the draw (which is good and bad) but I'd love the ability to lean into a spice build or a heal build and sometimes you just can't find what you need, even over multiple runs. 

My other big gripe is that I don't think the unlocks really add that much to the game. I've unlocked everything except for some achievement charms and one pet companion and so far many of the unlocks are super underwhelming (other than the pets. Still could be better but definitely can effect early gameplay in meaningful ways).

Overall, I really like the game but at hour 30 I'm starting to lose interest. Would definitely recommend and would love to see some DLC in the future but (unless I'm missing something I haven't unlocked yet that's totally game changing) I personally think other games of this genre like StS have more long-term replayability.","0","1711470640","true","1774","7441","47","2","0","0","0","1"

the skill and understanding demands are harsh from the outset, there is no ramping up in difficulty where you need to shed the crutches that you were using, it kicks you in the knee day one and says 'no crutches' then it gives you the 'opportunity' to make it harder. 

and maybe its just that i need to 'git gud' but no matter how much i lose i dont feel like i am learning anything. there is no 'you are doing poorly' feedback, you just die. sometimes suddenly as a interaction you didn't notice instantly kills your leader. 

in StS you have the buffer of your health to teach you 'you arent blocking enough' 'you dont deal enough damage'  'your deck is too bloated' 'you arent scaling fast enough' its straightforward to see what you are doing wrong because the game tells you by stabbing your HP. and you have ascension 0-20 to learn and improve. sometimes i have times where im just 'yep i just got bad luck that run' but usually i at least can see what i was doing wrong, even if im not good enough to actually do it better. 
in wildfrost every death is just 'guess i died... again'

i do like this game, the art and music and yes even the gameplay are great, but i cannot actually enjoy playing it or recommend it to anyone unless you are seriously good at deckbuilders, like seriously good.

Because you can only play 1 card each turn every card played must be as optimal as possible. 

In addition the fact that you need to beat your old deck every time you beat the game is kinda neat but you can really shoot yourself in the foot by finishing the game with a deck that requires a very lucky hand to beat. Simply because the deck you built the last time counters a lot of builds or was just very good. Poison builds in particular can cause a lot of problems as most decks can't effecively deal with it and most runs end if your main character gets poisoned. 

I think  that a lot of the complaints about difficulty and my own complaints can be fairly simply resolved by implementing some sort of scaling to the main hero seperate for your other characters that make them more survivable. 20 hp just isn't enough in many cases and given that there is no taunt system there are quite a few rng attacks that can just end your run if you roll the dice badly.","0.514458715915679932","1710615491","false","252","252","0","17","0","4","0","0"

Generally: It's difficult, but fun. 
It really is single player only. Which is a massive missed opportunity at making a potentially AMAZING game that plays like a single player only hearthstone in a lot of ways.

It would sell a bajillion copies if it had a hearthstone-alike multiplayer mode. Even if the mechanics and setup weren't the exact same as the main campaign type game, with perhaps a larger playfield where you could play more units, their health pools could maybe be larger, and maybe some hero type cards could have large health pools, or you have a stone or some item that you're trying to do damage to that acts like a target. I could see a lot of ways they could do multiplayer in this game. 

Some critiques:

There is absolutely no handholding about new cards you get, which can end a run due to just not fully understanding a card's mechanics for a brand new card. I suppose this applies maybe to a lot of games like this, but it's definitely an issue (Imo) with Wildfrost. 

I suppose that's part of the difficulty of the game, but for a new player, it really really sucks when you're on a good run with some brand new cards and heroes, and you lose to not understanding a brand new card that has fairly awful text that doesn't really explain what the card does, or a card interaction that you had no idea could even happen (as an example, you can get a card that applies a damage effect to all cards when it's on the board. OK, straight forward. Is it as straight forward that that effect can kill your own units when you're using a healing item on a friendly unit? There is absolutely no mouseover text that indicates this. So ending a long run from an interaction like this REALLY sucks, and the game could use maybe some mouseover text or popup text on all new cards to explain interactions, or like a 'WARNING' text. Of course, you learn these abilities fast, but it sucks losing what would otherwise be a good run to something like that.

You can't keep your existing premade decks from a run. I get that it's a roguelite, but this game seems SPECIFICALLY well suited to keeping specific decks.  I specifically think that the game creates this annoying sense of loss when you lose a run, mostly because you might've had an interesting custom build going on, and losing the run means you've lost all that effort of building it.
It really needs multiplayer with custom saved decks and saved cards/units. It would do very well I think - varied modes like wild and standard in hearthstone, there's a ton of potential here.

So TLDR: Game is good but quite hard, and quite fun.

The devs (imo) REALLY need to make some different game modes including a multiplayer (even if it's not very balanced initially) - they would make a lot of money if they did.

Since new card interactions can lose you a run quite quickly, by not understanding interactions, which sucks (a 1 a run resurrect stone, or a new ressurect after X battles might be a good addition  -- even as a noob friendly option - for those people that want to really get into the meat of the game and try different builds without being screwed by choosing a card that doesn't synergize perfectly, etc).

really excited to play this game. It is my favorite genre and it looked to offer something new... and it does! the puzzle and mechanics feel very fresh however there are some things that other games do so much better. Here are my cons from largest to smallest. 
- There is very little progression. In the beginning if feels like unlocks are thrown at you constantly but they do not feel valuable or earned because you have no idea what anything does. When you win a round you come to the hollow reality that this is it. 
- It is very punishing. I wish there was an end turn button because sometimes I will play a card and forget to rearrange my people first and as a result I will die and the run will be over. Runs snowball hard, it doesn't not reward you for just getting by. The injury mechanic seems unnecessary. 
- It does not feel balanced. There are good cards and there are bad cards and since the difficulty is so high you feel punished for trying new things. 

I could see how some people really like this game. The mechanics, soundtrack and visuals are awesome. Unfortunately somethings get in the way to make me not want to go back in the way that STS, Monstertrain, Peglin, Crowntrick made me want to. If you haven't played the expansion to monstertrain it is a masterclass. Crowntrick is a little known gem","0.490463197231292725","1685968783","true","206","1807","30","38","0","0","0","0"

I love this game, I play tons of deckbuilders and this one is exceptional. Its such a hard thing to pull the trigger on but I just don't think this game is very rewarding after a certain point, along with some rather glaring flaws that I think hold it back from being more fun to play. 

THE GOOD:
- Charming adorable art style, absolutely in love with it. I'd pay for real charms to put on my phone/bag
- Soundtrack is cute and never gets old imo. I whistle the main menu theme all the time. 
- Easy to play, tough to master. VERY good snowballing. When a run works it fucking WORKS. Nothing more satisfying than getting a perfectly overpowered run. 
- Good strategy mechanics. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the managing of the 2 different lanes and moving units around to optimize turns. Very well done. 

THE BAD: 
- No way to say no to ANYTHING. Deck bloat becomes mandatory on some runs and you have to miss out on map rewards to get rid of 2 of a possible MANY cards you need/want to get rid of. I've had dozens of runs end because I couldn't draw what I needed due to a bloated deck that I couldn't avoid. 
- No rewards after battles. This one could be a nitpick. I admit that the amount of cards and charms you get from the map and from shops all at once is a good amount, but even tough as nails games like slay the spire give you a card or SOMETHING after you beat a fight. And some of the fights in this game are fucking HARD. Barely eking out a win feels so bittersweet when you see that there's nothing on the map after it that will help you, or you get useless cards/charms from the RNG. 
- No sense of progression after comparatively little time. Look, getting gilded frames and the true ending for beating the final boss with the bad bells is cool and all. But you're telling me I only unlocked 3 map events, 3 decks, and a handfull of companions and pets (which arent hard to get AT ALL) and then all progression just, ends? There's nothing but grinding out the true ending of the game after everything in town is unlocked. 'But what about the charms?' I dont super count the things that you could barely see once across 10 different runs very rewarding either. After a while it just feels like the game is beating your ass for trying to play it. 

Between ridiculously hard encounters (some of which just amount to flat DPS checks that if your deck isn't up to snuff on will just end your run with no way to puzzle them out.), unrewarding long haul gameplay, and way more lack of control than I usually feel in a deckbuilder like this, I just kinda think Wildfrost is a hard sell. Its difficulty needs some major tuning before I personally think it can stand next to the big ones like Slay the spire and Monster Train. But that's one humble woman's opinion. The game IS fun, and the game IS good, and I encourage you to at least try it on sale. But get your money back if you don't like it.

Edit: Coming back to say that the final boss mechanic is novel until you create an unbeatable monster. Being punished on subsequent runs for doing well on a previous one feels very bad after a while.

I think its biggest strength lies in the card customization system where you can add 'charms' to cards giving them extra effects, this enables all sort of fun strategies and combos.

_______________

As many other reviews have said, this game is beautiful with great mechanics and is incredibly engaging. That's why I'm having a hard time writing this. I can't recommend this game in its current state. I play a lot of games in this genre, and the balancing in this is outright unacceptable.

I did manage to beat the main run on my third attempt. Obviously, roguelikes/roguelites encourage replayability so the end is never really the end. I have since played 20-ish runs with many of those ending on the first fight of the run. Almost every other one dies at about the second boss. The scaling on this isn't just 'punishing'. It becomes literally impossible.

To clarify I'll give an example of a recurring fight in my run.

My characters will have approximately 8-12 health, and attack every 4-6 cards that I play. This encounter starts with 3 enemies who hit for 2 to 5 damage. Approximately every 3-4 turns. They have abilities such that I will hit them at random, then 2 out of the 3 enemies will do retaliation damage for 3 if I hit them. This means that you're virtually guaranteed to die to just this combo purely due to retaliation damage. They have approximately 12 health as well, so unless you have substantial OTK potential you just wont get past them. That might be enough to entice some people who want a challenge, but wait there's more. Multiple more enemies will join this fight, before a BOSS will join. All of these enemies will deal retaliation damage until you kill the mob applying it, and you can't kill him until you get the appropriate RNG to actually target him. Every time you miss you'll take retaliation damage.

That's just one example. Most fights are like this. I'm probably going to have to shelf this one until it gets a patch. It's a shame. I'm a huge fan of Chucklefish but this needed more playtesting.

Misc. notes:
-Action economy needs better options than just Noomlin. In many fights noomlin ends up action neutral. Enemies get far too many actions in comparison to the player. I dont think it's necessary to reduce the number of enemies, just reduce the frequency with which they can act relative to the player.
-Add more uses for the bread charm? 'Consume' isn't useful as a deck thinning mechanic because the current state of the game doesn't make loops viable. 
- Introduce more card loops, the current state is bad for both game balance and feel. A prime appeal of this genre is the ability to make intricate combos that leave an enemy helpless. It feels bad to spend so much time watching the enemies beat up on you.
-Either increase player effect values or player attack frequency. A character who adds a -2 temp damage with barrage is only going to end up attacking 2-3x in an efficiently run fight. That is at best 6 damage mitigation. That's pretty meaningless when many enemies can hit for 5+ regularly.","0.5","1681441354","true","527","15805","0","2","0","0","0","0"

Compared to a game like monster train where all the information is shown to you, like how much health all of your minions and enemies will have after each round.

It scratched the STS and Monster Train itch for me. Bafflingly it was harder than Monster Train, and about equally as difficult as STS which I appreciated, although I miss the random events. With STS you get the sense within the world that you're getting close to escaping the tower as you progress upward. There are elite, regular, and boss enemies. Here there are just bosses and regular enemies, and so it feels a little more shallow. There also aren't as many relics. 

That said, I highly reccomend this to STS who are looking for something to fill the void. 3.5/5","0","1708740602","true","1332","5498","0","8","0","0","0","0"

The game loop is smart and keeps you coming back for more. The Hero Draft means you can try many deck styles, which keeps the game fresh. Even if you're new to card games or you've played a lot, Wild Frost is fun and welcoming.

There's a card that hits anything that is applied with snow (stun). Turns out it hits not just enemies applied with snow but also your own allies. Lost a good run that way.

The game as a whole is extremely addictive and well-designed, as well as polished to a mirror sheen. The Storm Bell system feels like a natural counterpart to the game, allowing there to be 'ascensions' in which the game gets progressively tougher.

The game also has flaws, however. The main problem is that the normal ending is tremendously unsatisfying. To reach a true ending, one must reach a high level of ascensions, gradually cranking up the difficulty. What was formerly a fair level of RNG in standard runs becomes frustrating as the heroes and characters you roll may just be 'bad' or non-synergizing ones, sabotaging your whole run and wasting time. In my experience, some abilities and status effects are just better.

It doesn't really feel fully possible to escape poor luck in the game, if you get screwed by RNG you just have to try again. The game is still fun, but the feeling you get when you lose is just 'welp, expected that', which shouldn't really be the case.

Then there are the cases when you die simply because of some tiny effect you missed. The game gives you infinite time to check what an enemy will do, so there isn't really an excuse on the player's part for getting screwed in that way. But sometimes chains of events happen to the point it's not obvious at all. The game doesn't exactly warn you when these things are about to happen.

The true final boss feels like it's designed to be beaten using a very narrow set of strategies. There isn't much room for divergence, which kind of hurts the freedom of having a different build. This was sort of the case in Slay the Spire too, but I felt there was still more room to maneuver there.

Ultimately the game feels somewhat unfinished and I wish the true ending was more fulfilling or that it had some kind of lasting effect. It was more 'worth it' in my imagination than actual reality. It's possible that subsequent patches will expand the game a bit more, as it really needs it. Still, easily worth the relatively low price it's going for.","0","1704409307","true","2329","2844","0","126","944","0","0","0"

I tried many games to find one similar to Slay the Spire.

Some were great but too different (Inscryption, Backpack Hero)
Some I couldn't get into (Across the Obelisk, Monster Train)
And a lot of average copycats (YaoGuai Hunter, Neoverse)

I think Wildfrost and Griftlands were the best similar yet unique approaches in roguelike deckbuilders.

I was on the fence to try this due to average reviews during launch. I'm glad I did, it's a solid game.","0.756001710891723633","1706547138","true","5344","18584","0","34","0","25","0","0"

Gameplay is similar to Monster Train, so if you’ve previously played that game, you should be familiar with how most of this works.

[h1]Combat[/h1]

•	Combat takes place on a 6x2 grid, where the player and the enemy each control half of the board. Each fight will have a couple of waves of enemy reinforcements which spawn after a few turns, eventually leading to a boss. You’ll win the fight by killing the boss, but you’ll lose if your leader dies.

•	Each character has stats for health, attack, and turn timer. Every time you play a card, the turn timer for all characters on the board will reduce by 1, and they’ll attack when their individual timer reaches 0.

•	Most characters will attack the opponent at the front of their row, although some have special abilities such as longshot (hits the back of the row), barrage (hits every opponent on the row), or aimless (hits a random opponent on the row). You can rearrange the position of your minions during each turn to control which enemy they’ll attack, while trying to protect weaker minions from enemy attacks.

•	Your cards can summon minions, heal a minion, damage an enemy, or apply various status effects such as poison which deals damage over time, snow which delays the character’s turn, or ink which temporarily disables special abilities.

•	You can also summon clunkers, which are machines who have special health bars. Their health only reduces by a single point each time they’re hit, but most of the time they can’t be healed. Their primary use is to protect minions from high damage attacks, but they often have a special ability, for example an attack which triggers every time you apply snow.

•	Between fights, minions can be upgraded with charms to make them more powerful. As well as increasing health or attack, you can give them special abilities such as multistrike or smackback (counter attack when hit), or add status effects to their attacks. 

•	Some minions have abilities which can synergise together. For example, one applies snow to all enemies, while another increases attack power every time a character is snowed. A few minions can heal allies, while another increases attack power every time he’s healed.

•	The difficulty level can feel quite punishing to begin with, but over time I gradually started to feel more comfortable. The enemies are actually quite well balanced, and I never felt like a fight was impossible because an enemy completely countered my deck.

•	The thing that caused me most problems is the fact that Wildfrost doesn’t have a Monster Train style damage preview to indicate which characters are likely to die at the end of a turn, so I have to try to calculate everything in my head. Quite often the fights will be 6v6, which means on most turns, several attacks and special abilities will trigger, but sometimes I forget about an enemy’s special ability, so I incorrectly think I’m safe. For example, remember that snow clunker I mentioned earlier? I lost one run because an enemy snowed my leader, who then got killed by friendly fire. Until that exact moment, I didn’t even realise that friendly fire was possible. But of course the more runs I played, I learned to slow down and pay more attention to things like that, which helped me to win more consistently.

[h1]Run structure[/h1]

•	At the start of each run you’ll need to choose between 3 leaders with randomly generated stats and abilities, which makes each run slightly different.

•	Between battles the node layout is similar to Monster Train, where you’ll choose between 2 paths which each contain 2-3 nodes, allowing you to recruit a minion, add/remove/duplicate cards, acquire charms or gold, and buy items from a shop.

•	Storm bells allow you to add negative modifiers to increase the difficulty, similar to Slay The Spire ascension or Monster Train covenant, except in Wildfrost you can choose which ones you want to add. If you can win with 10 storm bells enabled, you’ll be able to fight the true final boss.

•	It took me 24 hours to unlock and defeat the final boss. There are also daily challenges which can add some extra replay value.

[h1]Recommendation[/h1]

1) BALANCE: It feels like some cards are severely under powered or significantly harder to get synergies for, while others are easier to build decks around and are overall stronger. I like trying to go for builds when the opportunity arises, and wildfrost for whatever reason always seems to push you towards the same stale builds, I suspect because they are OP. This often results in going for the same decks time and time again as I'm trying to win and the cards with certain effects are just simply better. I think overall balance between the cards would help here.

2) REPLAYABILITY/DISCOVERY: It's relatively easy and quick to unlock most things and beat the game, I'm currently at 36 hours on record and I would say I had all the major unlocks at the 20~ hour mark. Great by some standards, but for a card rougelike it's a little underwhelming. I want incentives to keep playing! I want new things to discover! New viable strategies to try! I would love to see more cards and unlocks. I think more cards + balance especially would help with the replayability as there would be more viable builds and strategies to try out.

Overall, a great game I would recommend, but leaves me yearning for what could have been.","0","1706044166","true","2157","2813","0","25","843","0","0","0"

im trying to get the true ending... and all i can say is that it gets old really quick

if you just try to beat it like you're ''normally'' supposed to, you'll enjoy it and then either keep playing it until you're bored of it or just call it quits, but im not sure if wildfrost was meant to be replayed this many times, maybe it's just a skill issue or just bad luck with what cards i get, but lord do i hate the final boss and the grind to reach it

i like the idea of giving yourself handicaps that you can decide, but having the player do that about six times in a row just to get to the meat and potatos of challenge mode feels boring, let me test my skill and just let me get to lvl 10 from the getgo so i don't have to do what i already did before, just repeated and with a small handicap that i can deal with, maybe if it went higher in 2 by 2 instead of 1 by 1...

i think there is a reason why enemies pour slowly instead of giving you a wall to begin with (reason i dislike whooly drek too, but it's not as bad compared to it) you just can't build up your strategy because everything you place is dead, frozen or debuffed beyond oblivion before you start

they also have ridiculous ammounts of HP and attack along each one having a quirk that you have to take account for, so unless you build your deck specifically to deal with them OR get a breaking run (borderline impossible since there is basically zero ''really strong'' sinergies in this game) you're out of luck, so good luck replaying the two same areas with the eight or so same bosses over and over until you get lucky enough and then get screwed anyways because you forgot a single one of the card's descriptions and that so happens to kill your entire deck from the inside out (not the enemy's tough they are still perfectly fine having like 60 HP, when the average up to the boss is no more than 50 or so at worst)

that also brings me to the point of there being *no synergies* between items, allies and charms, or them being so ambiguous to the point that you don't know if they work or they dont (80% of the time they don't, so you just wasted that precious item wich you needed to have a chance at the run, gg restart) so there is no point in experimentation or even playing if you know anything you want to try will not work and you will just run the same exact allies and items (or hope to get them) to just win, if even so

''why play if you don't like it then? you did finish all the game had to offer besides that''

compromise, if i payed for this and the REAL ending happens to be locked behind the most exhausting roadblock ever im still gonna try it to know that i really did beat the game and then i can put it to rest, leaving it unfinished on my library doesn't sit right

TLDR: game is pretty good until you have to reach the real bossfight, then it devolves into repetition

There's surprisingly little RNG for a game of this genre, especially in combat. Every time I lose a game, I know why and how I could have played it differently, never 'well I never saw card X!'.

I would say the starting difficulty is harder than most games of this genre, but it pretty quickly becomes manageable. The scaling modifiers ('bells') are neat and work well. There is definitely a lot to pay attention to, since nearly every friendly & enemy unit has a countdown, abilities, health, and damage. It means I need to focus to make sure I'm thinking through each action, so I found it hard to zone out and just chill, even on easier difficulties.

The only real problem I had with the game is replayability: because there is so little RNG I found games feeling rather familiar after about 20 hours. I'm sure that's because I wasn't pushing the difficulty very much - it does change how the game plays.

I've player a lot of rogue likes, but nothing as fun as this. I've been playing for close to half a year now. As a fan of deck building and rogue likes, I can say that this hits that itch nicely, while being something I can do almost mindlessly now, but that occasional moment of needing to get myself out of hell itself is such a thrill here. This game feels like building an engine that can run on its own but with the additional challenges that pop up over time you find yourself surprised by something throwing a hitch into it, and have to fix the machine to get it working again. Its strange to say that this is my comfort game as its still one of the most difficult I've played too, but it manages to make it possible for me to get the best of both vibes so to speak.

If you enjoy Slay the Spire likes where the battles ALSO have a tabletop gaming style dimension where the placement of your units matters, or card battling games such as Duelyst and Poxnora where you are playing from a deck BUT the tactics you use for your already played units on a map are very important, then you will likely enjoy this too.

[h3] Concise Review [/h3]
Roguelite runs taking anywhere from 20-90 minutes or so are the core of the game, starting out with a ‘Clan’ that determines your choice of starting hero and deck, with options for run-modifiers that add difficulty. 

Some key features:

You progress through multiple areas / acts each run, with a single combat at the end of the area

Within each area, you have a choice of which path to follow (just one choice) which determines which things you can modify within your deck, including new cards, card modifiers, card duplication and card removal

Within the end-area combats, you deploy your unit cards to a pair of rows on your side of a map, and the enemy deploys to the other side. Factors in play are countdown management prior to units activating, deck cycling to reach, play and replay preferred cards, and managing the placement of units for both offensive and defensive advantage.

[h3] Highlights? [/h3]

[u] Highly Tactical Combat [/u]
There are only 6 (or so) combats within each run, but each combat may last 5+ minutes (unless rushing) and be very satisfying, with multiple key choice points. The combat excels are providing you with both dilemmas and options to resolve them. Sometimes you can streak to victory. Sometimes you have to choose the least bad option and try and succeed with fewer resources and from a weaker board-state.

[u] Generous Deck Building [/u]
Some games, like Slay, are miserly in the deck building options you have, and some essentially require you to decline most that you are offered, lest you end up with a bloated, inefficient deck.
Wildfrost provides lot of options to add, take away, and change how your existing cards perform. In the areas leading to combats, excluding the first, you typically have 3-4 nodes where you can make one or more changes, and shops allow  you to make as many changes as you have coins to spend. 

[u] Great visuals and animations [/u]
Compared to a lot of deck builders / battlers with great gameplay and basic visuals, Wildfrost has both. Delivering big hits FEELS visceral, as your enemy card is physically spun 360 on screen. Boom!

[u] Daily Runs [/u]
Love this feature, wish more games had it! In addition to a story campaign you have Daily Runs, which give you and all other players the same deck. This provides a pretty compelling reason to keep playing, especially if you like to compete for high scores, but also if you just like to take on randomised challenges. The scoring is based off the number of coins you keep (not spent) and the time you take on the run. As a very slow gamer, I might prefer the time element was absent, but the challenges are still interesting and varied.

[h3] Lowlights? [/h3]

[u] You can die [/u]
Not actually a lowlight! Yet this might explain why this game is not at “Very Positive” or “Overwhelmingly Positive”, as it could be. 

The cartoony presentation belies some occasionally very challenging gameplay. If you are not paying close attention, it is entirely possible to have a fantastic deck and be close to a successful run and then boom, you neglected to notice that your hero had a debuff which doubled their next damage taken, or that the monster they were facing off against had frenzy status which increased their number of attacks, or . . . many other similar things. 
It reads like some earlier experience of this was not to the delight of some players, and also that post-release development has provided some mitigation against the worst of the causes. 

[h3] Meta Progression [/h3]
There is lots of it. Between runs, you return to a village, and the village has a whole array of various buildings each of which have a number of things that unlock as you play. New companions, new cards, new card modifiers. Initially, the number you get can be just a little overwhelming, but the pace after you are 6+ runs in is perhaps 1 or 2 things per run.","0","1705250478","true","1339","16494","0","35","0","0","0","0"

I am a huge fan of this kind of game - I have ~800 hours of Spire on console, several hundred hours of Monster Train, Roguebook, Griftlands, Void, etc. I've played Across the Obelisk. 

This game has the positional play of (the lesser known) Nowhere Prophet and maybe a design methodology similar to Monster Train (i.e. near the end to win your run needs to 'break the game'). It is more difficult than Monster Train at the respective highest 'ascension' levels, though not as difficult as Spire. The art direction, sound design, etc. is pretty great. The content available right now is pretty great. 

I'm not sure any game will topple Spire for many many years to come - part of what makes Spire so amazing is how impeccably balanced it is. Monster Train circumvented this comparison to Spire by way of making the game all about 'break our game and that's how you win' - so balance is pretty secondary. So by avoiding that... I'd say MT takes the #2 spot, then, for roguelike deckbuilding games. Wildfrost can earnestly compete for the #3 spot alongside Roguebook. The only real problem I have with Wildfrost is the Overcranked game mode is such a massive leap from 'Ascension 10', which is as high as you can go before going Overcranked. It's like if Spire let you play up to Ascension 10, then the next Ascension was Ascension 20... it's a rather jarring transition to turn on this mode, and you have to relearn everything you thought you knew about the game to compete on this mode. The slow build up other similar games offer makes it easier to understand, and also adds longevity to the game. I no-lifed the game over a weekend and managed to beat 'ascension' 10 3 times to unlock Overcranked... that was pretty fast compared to similar games. But now my only option for continued play is to slam my head into the wall that is Overcranked without any 'ramp up' to that. I'm not sure it's thoughtful difficulty design compared to similar games.

But anyways these small qualms aside - it's definitely worth the pick up","0.658809959888458252","1704906921","true","1966","4783","0","24","0","10","1","0"

In terms of balance, I think people usually have too high an expectation in that regard. Not every card game has to have Slay the Spire's millage to be worth your time.

On the downside however, the amount of existing content is less than StS or Monster Train, so you may have fewer hours with this game. If the devs would expand on what they already have and introduce more diversity in their card pool - which I see no reason why they couldn't - the game stands to be something truly impressive.","0","1704620815","true","439","2587","0","31","0","0","0","0"

[b] Pros [/b]
+ the blend of tactics-lite unit positioning with card based abilities to support is one of those great 'easy to learn, difficult to master' systems. You really have to think about both all the time to win, and that makes every turn and play feel meaningful and engaging.
+ The three factions manage to strike a balance between feeling very distinct and not feeling like you're playing an entirely different game between them (something I think StS gets a bit wrong)
+ The Charm system gives you a lot of room to upgrade your cards in unique ways. The right combination can completely change how you use a spell or unit and adds some spice to each run.
+ Cannot stress the 'polish' factor enough, everything from the controls (played on Steam deck) to the subtle animations on every interaction gives the game a great feel
+ Really unique enemies and bosses that are fun to fight and rarely feel cheap or frustrating. You really have to think about the interactions of enemy abilities before every play, but there's more than one answer to every encounter.

[b] Cons [/b]
- Balance between the factions feels a bit iffy. I got relatively easy wins with the first and third faction, but felt like I had to pull some really particular cards with the second to create an effective deck.
- Balance between cards and keywords also seems uneven to me. With two exceptions, Wildfrost locks you to playing one card per 'turn', effectively making it the same resource cost to play every card. This led to many cards I never chose again after a second or third try because they just didn't do enough to advance the board state or required too much setup to deliver their value.
- Enemies and bosses are great but the roster is a little thin. The game builds its replay value around a prestige mode with lots of difficulty modifiers you can stack together, but I felt like I had seen everything after a few completions with each faction.

Look, this game is possibly my favourite right now. Playing it almost every day. It just needs some major polishes:

* End-of-turn consequences need to be displayed. This game can get highly complicated, and it has often taken just one detail I missed consideration of that ends my fun and amazing run. It can be a gentle red flashing transparent skull symbol for allies and enemies that will die upon end-of-turn, that would be enough for me.

* Jargon interaction clarifications. There are many statuses and abilities that can affect each other, and the nature of said affects needs to be clearly explained both during battles and whenever reviewing cards, such as trying to decide which card to place a charm on.

Dammit I forgot my other points, will have to come back and edit this review because stupid Steam deleted my WIP review.

Art is great, music fits the theme, gameplay is intuitive and varied (at least at the start). Not usually a fan of deck building games but this one drew me in and kept me around a while.

My only real gripe is with the lack of end game. Once you've completed a few runs, the only way to up the challenge is by adding negative passives that either harm you or buff enemies. Fine and all, but each passive has a value 1-3 depending on severity, and you can cap out at 10 total value for the game. Combine that, with the fact that there is a relatively small pool of encounters, including the bosses, that can happen each run, and it doesn't take too long to complete the game at its hardest, without much room for variety. I'd like to see that cap raised with more challenge options added, along with maybe some more difficult encounters/bosses that can begin appearing past certain completion numbers.

Overall though, as stated before, this is a good game and worth the time I've played. Lends itself well to expansion and I'd like to see it grow from here.","0.47826087474822998","1704184355","true","1365","3712","0","28","0","0","0","0"

I recommend it, of course, but there are a few crucial things to be aware of when it comes to making your decision to buy and play Wildfrost. Firstly...

[b]It's a cute game. [/b]The characters are cute. The sounds are cute. Everything is cute. Everything has a nice punchy feel and the game is satisfying to play. Coins clink to the ground when enemies are defeated, bells let out a long ring when they are clicked on and items kind of 'inhale' when they are about to explode. Everything feels good, it'll almost make you forget that...

[b] This game can be quite difficult. [/b] Of course, it'll depend on your knowledge of deck building and experience with the game, all of which you'll get better at as you go through various runs. While this is a deck builder like Slay the Spire, your choice of allies and the upgrades you apply to them matter just as much as the cards you put into your deck. Your best cards will usually be one-time use per battle, so you'll need consistent control over the battlefield with your main character and allies. Because of this, there are a lot of things to keep track of. Sometimes an ally attack will mess up your positioning, or they'll activate an enemies passive that'll cause a turn to descend into chaos. It'll usually be your fault though because...

[b] There is little RNG (Randomness) [/b], you'll usually lose most runs to a single mistake that you've made. There is no reset, rewind, or a way to unmake those mistakes and it'll be frustrating when it happens. Each turn, your attention will be divided across your allies and enemies meaning it'll be that much more easy to make a mistake. Of course, this is a turn-based game, so there is no reaction speed or action command you'll need to do, but an impatient person could pass a turn that looks good on the surface and end up with your character dying to a passive ability you missed or a miscalculated counter of something on the enemy side. Sometimes, it does come down to the RNG that is included in the game. There are a few abilities that make an enemy attack a random character in a row, but this can be manipulated with...

[b] Complete freedom of positioning. [/b]This part of the game is what made this game so fun for me, and what brought me to play this game for god knows how long. On your turn (which is basically whenever characters aren't attacking), you can click and drag your characters around freely. Reordering them to split damage, pulling an ally off the front lines, or even having an ally block an entire row of damage while your injured or more fragile allies hide in a more protected row. With certain cards, you can do some insanely clever things that'll reward those who can deeply understand the mechanics of this game. Because positioning is completely free, you can 'react' and reposition when enemies spawn, when an attack lands somewhere unexpected, or when one of the allies gets knocked out. Free-Repositioning is a skill you'll get better at as you play, especially since...

[b] This game is very replayable. [/b]There are a few different clans for you to choose from, all with their unique keywords, allies, cards, passives, and unique mechanics. I won't spoil them all here, but you'll be able to replay the game several times in very different ways, all which will improve your abilities, unlock charms and allies, and when you finally do beat the game, you'll be able to replay the game on higher difficulties with more challenges, allowing you to get closer and closer to fighting the true final boss and achieving the full ending. 

I do recommend this game, and it's worth your time. It'll take some time to master as the difficulty increases, and sometimes you'll lose in a way that'll seem unfair or infuriating, but a single run doesn't last that long and you'll find yourself coming back and playing again pretty soon. Definitely consider picking this up.","0.827410399913787842","1704260299","true","6908","9734","0","2","0","47","0","0"

Game's hard, game's good, game's balanced despite complaints, game's not beginner friendly but also very learnable if you're not afraid of learning through failure, devs have something special here and should be proud.

Full Review:
Won my second ever run of this game [strike] skill issue @ any complaints [/strike]

In all seriousness, I did play the demo for a few hours a while back so I did have a bit of a head start. [strike] I would say its starting difficulty definitely demands above average understanding of generally applicable card game meta/strategy. [/strike] For context, I'm one of those weirdos with over 400 hours and 100% completion in Slay the Spire so I somewhat understand where folks are coming from with complaints about difficulty. I'd say I got a bit lucky with my build and my first run hit a pretty hard wall halfway through. [strike] My first impression is that this game is a bit more unapproachable than you might think and if the cute art style would lead you to believe it's beginner friendly, it ain't. [/strike]

EDIT [pre 1.1.0 'Storm Bell Update'] : I said I'd add more thoughts after playing more, and after another 10 hours and about 18 runs later I've managed to beat the true ending, which I won't elaborate on other than saying it's fairly straightforward. My initial impression that this game isn't beginner friendly was reaffirmed, but it's definitely well balanced and learnable, so I very much hope that the devs don't implement many balance changes purely to appease complaints. If anything, optional easier modifiers for newbies that don't affect the base game would be the best solution, we'll see how it goes. I very much enjoy the balance of the game and find each build archetype to be strong when synergized, versatile when blended, and with varying degrees of complexity to wield, which is exactly what I'm looking for in these sorts of games.

EDIT 2 [post 1.1.0]: The reduction of base game difficulty and introduction of storm bell modifiers, while not exactly how I expected an ease on the new player experience to be introduced, is basically the next best alternative, and implemented in a mostly non-obtrusive way to long time players. My only gripe with it is that I'm forced to win 1 run at a time to slowly increase my bell modifier cap when I'm already accustomed to/capable of an experience of at least 10 points of difficulty, but on the whole I think the idea is solid. I do miss the old bells slightly, but the new mix is much more modular and lowers the new player skill requirements at base game. Don't get me wrong, I still think this game is a bit tough on newbies and folks will absolutely be running into instant death during the mechanics learning experience, but the odds are slightly more in your favor in a well balanced way that doesn't compromise the original game's vision. Even still, I've crossed out earlier bits of my review saying this game is unfriendly to new players - now's a better time than ever to get into the genre with this game as your intro!

As far as my impression on how this game plays as a roguelite go, it's modern, aka you gain persistent unlocks in the form of new items, clans, characters, charms, etc. added to your pool, though this aspect is tastefully and intelligently restrained; it doesn't suffer nearly as much as other games from item bloat, aside from maybe the number of available charms, but for the most part (of what I've unlocked) they're all decent/viable and don't ruin late stage playability. The difficulty modifiers are also quite nice, since they're not just flat downgrades, they're solidly designed trade-offs that advance with your own skill in the game and are likewise neither excessive nor lazily implemented.

I don't really have much negative to say, though as a small note, total content in this game is (relatively and understandably) small, though there's still many hours of replayability. Less of a complaint and more to say that it feels very well suited to be expanded upon, which the devs have already hinted at, so I'm hopeful for the future of this game, since it's already exceptional as is!

EDIT: At time of writing, the next roadmap update (after 1.1.0) is supposedly going to be a cards/enemy expansion with a couple new mechanics and added depth so while I don't think this game needs it to be good, anything that makes it even better is welcome.

The devs clearly put a lot of care into creating a satisfying and cohesive balance and game feel for Wildfrost, so I'll end with a slight modification to my original initial impression's conclusion - If you like card strategy (Slay the Spire, Monster Train) or just very puzzle oriented turn based strategy (Into the Breach and such) and have sunk enough hours into any such game to have a fairly strong understanding of card/strategy meta (tempo, synergy, turn order, valuing card draw and deck thinning etc.) you're going to have a good time, [strike] but if you're new to the genre be aware this isn't the most approachable game. [/strike] EDIT: it's a bit more approachable now without compromising any of the difficulty options :) That said, I'd say give it a shot if you're curious and understand what you're getting into, while hard, it's definitely not impossible to learn and if you're capable of ignoring a little toxicity (as all 'difficult' games seem to garner), this game is already amassing a fairly welcoming side to its community that'd be happy to pass along some advice!","0.503733634948730469","1682074698","true","135","8250","0","19","574","2","0","0"

The best way I can describe this game is that is like Slay the Spire, but up to 12 different allies/enemies can be on the screen at once, and are ALL on independent action timers, so there is a lot to track and this game will absolutely kill you if you're careless. A big note, though, is that nearly everything that happens in combat is deterministic, so you can still plan things out and aren't just subject to the whims of RNG. As a result, I rapidly go back and forth between feeling like a genius and a complete moron when I figure out some tricky combo or die because I overlooked how a particular turn would play out. When you lose, though, it nearly always feels fair because the outcomes are staring you in the face the whole time. As of the last patch, you can tell which fights you're coming up to on the map, which allows you to rearrange your army ahead of time to not get blindsided by a hard-counter.

The game got review-bombed on launch due to people thinking it's too difficult and unforgiving. Since then, the devs have made HUGE progress in lowering the base difficulty, adding in a ton of great QoL and run variety, and adding an ascension system similar to StS so that the max difficulty is now well above the original base game.

Art is fantastic. Music and sound are great. Gameplay is addictive as hell with plenty of new unlocks behind achievements and such. Absolutely a 10/10 game.","0","1703834692","true","4154","9675","181","16","0","0","0","0"

All in all, Wildfrost is a super balanced and hard experience that's easy to recommend. Graphics are pretty, sound design is solid and game is well done, although it falls on the short side in comparison to STS. Once you beat the final boss, your deck becomes the final boss of the next run, making it more and more difficult for you. It's a good idea, but a bit lazy in my opinion, offering a lot of replayability but not enough 'original' content. The developers could also have made more focus on the story instead of just giving you a few pages of lore here and there.

I found the gameplay itself to be innovative and not just a copy of STS. Battles can get super strategic and lots of tactics are needed to overcome certain bosses. Other than that, you have your hub, powers, market, card duplicator and all that that you're probably used to already if you have played other games in the genre. UX is easy to use, and as I mentioned before, I couldn't put the game down until I beat it.

New impression is that the latest updates absolutely let you tune difficulty to what you want, instead of needing an absolutely perfect RNG run to win (or even get close to the end).

OLD:

Love these types of games. Slay the Spire, Monster Train, Griftlands, even Dicey Dungeon.

This game is so RNG oriented it's not fun to play - it's beautiful, the mechanics make sense and are reasonably simple, and the card diversity is pretty neat, but getting further in a run is just a complete crapshoot. There's no leeway unless you get the perfect combo of cards that happens to handle the level-by-level change up of enemy types.

You have a leader every combat, and that leader can't die or your run is over.  Creatures have different mechanics that cause abilities to hit for more damage, hit characters they normally wouldn't hit, etc.  My biggest complaint about this game is you can lose a run because you didn't realize your leader was going to take damage on a turn.  It kills the entire run.  I think this game needs a mechanic similar to Into the breach, or Roguebook, where lethal damage gets a visual alert before you end your turn.

It has some really cool mechanics with the charms (card augments), unit placements with the rows and front to back attack order, the various status ailments (both positive and negative), and the relatively unique tribes. It's also pretty well balanced so far, I win maybe 20-30% of my runs, with both RNG and my own mistakes coming into play there. It feels satisfying in both regards.

All of that being said, it feels like another 10 hours and I'm done with the game. If your goal is to just grind higher and higher difficulties (with various debuffs to a run that you can toggle on and off, although I see no benefit for pushing it other than maybe a couple hidden unlocks), then that's fine and you might love this game. But for me personally, one of my favorite part of rogue lites is unlocking new stuff and evolving my game play around that. Other than some of the charm unlocking through challenges, it seems like about 20 hours will cap out the new content, maybe more if you aren't familiar with this kind of genre. That's just not enough replay value for me.

It's a very well made game mechanics wise and art wise, I am enjoying it a lot, but I'm going to burn out quick in the next couple days. For a $20 game that's not terrible, but there's better bang for your buck out there in that regard. I really hope they focus on adding new content, and if they do--and the game evolves--I will change my my review. But for now my vote is to just wait for now unless you are either a casual player that might spend more time on this, or are a veteran just looking for something new within the genre.","0.474452555179595947","1703396075","false","669","1289","0","9","0","2","0","0"

Speaking of the game, damn if it doesnt have that 'one more go' air to it. While the archetypes can be linear at times, the deck building element when combined with the positioning of your leader and companions creates rewarding game play for the brewer and experimental players. Being able to upgrade your cards with charms that give them Keywords or change the text on them mean you can create some hilariously broken combinations with patience, a bit of luck and stratigising.

PREVIOUS REVIEW BELOW FROM ON RELEASE, FORMALLY NEGATIVE RATING
Early game is a boring rng shit show. You don't have any cool cards yet and the game just gives you scrap charms when you have no scrap cards in your deck. Cool thanks. Guess that run was a fucking waste of 30 mins.

Like at least let me look at all my shops before I have to commit to a card, or let me pick between two charms or something. I feel like only about 1/3 of my runs end up with actually cool builds, 2/3 times I'm just trying to pick strong cards (eg 10/5/4 berry dude) with absolutely no synergy so I don't die in the next fight.

You need to make it halfway through the game before the game actually becomes fun and interesting. Game is hard, which is cool but also extremely tedious.

Game has too many parasitic mechanics, ie cards that do literally nothing without other cards. Like it's cool when you do get the synergies, but it feels really fucking bad when 2/3 of your choices are unplayable.

The base difficulty needs to be easier, the first run is trivial, every run after that is too hard. You need a very specific build to counter your last team, and again there's not enough agency to actually assemble a counter. It took me 2 runs to beat the game the first time, and 30 runs to beat the game for the second time.

I'm gonna sink another 10 hours or so into this game and we'll see if anything changes.

Edit1: I'll probably change this to a positive review pending a good balance patch.

Edit2: I've cleared the final stage and most of the achievements. My final conclusion is that this game is a snowball fight simulator. You just play a few creatures and then let it snow, let it snow, let it snow! One guy left: should you kill that guy with a damage spell? NO! WRONG! Snowball your own creature instead to set up a combo kill. If you're not throwing snow EVERY TURN you are doing it wrong! How you gonna have all these garbage ass cards and then make snow 12 a card? The fuck? Game is badly in need of a balance patch!","0.419417202472686768","1682842529","true","495","1283","0","8","0","0","0","1"

One of the reasons I [i]felt[/i] like writing a review is the sheer amount of negative reviews I disagree with. The amount of 'too hard/too RNG' misinfo is off the charts! It's a very fair game. RNG-heavy? There's almost no combat RNG at all, almost everything is telegraphed and can be accounted for. The rewards you get are random, yes, but you can [i]always[/i] make a build that'll be able to beat the game. If you are genuinely trying to adapt to whatever you get, not just force a build you don't have pieces for, you'll never feel screwed by the RNG.

The game is punishing in a sense that losing your leader means losing the game—but you are [i]never[/i] put into such a situation if you pay attention! Wildfrost could be seen as a difficult game as base difficulty is higher than in, say, Slay the Spire. But once you have a grasp on game's mechanics, you can have endless win streaks. I've never felt bad after losing a run because it's very clear that you, the player, had done something wrong. And if you do everything right, it feels very rewarding to breeze through the fights. You need to plan ahead and pay attention to multiple timers, but it's not as scary as it might appear.

If there was something to criticize Wildfrost for, it's the potential playtime. Compared to games like Slay the Spire, replayability is on the lower side. There's no officially supported modding and content-wise game might get stale. But if you enjoy low-RNG roguelite deckbuilders, you'll have tons of fun trying to figure this game out. And I am looking forward for the mod support or official expansion—core gameplay is a blast.","0.652304291725158691","1703260706","true","4047","4559","0","27","173","22","0","2"

And Wildfrost is a deckbuilding rougelike, I kept my eyes on for quite some time, until I finally bought it. I already played Slay the Spire, Rougebook, Monstertrain and Vault of the Void. Slay the Spire and Vault of the Void are my favourites of this genre so far. Wildfrost won't change that.

Why though? It's a great game so far, the combat feels good and the overall design (art & music) is fitting really well. But I like the art style of the Vault of the Void a little bit more, the combat and game progress feels better in every rougelike (except Monstertrain) I've played so far.

If you never played a deckbuilding rougelike, but you want to try this genre, pick Slay the Spire or Vault of the Void (or maybe Rougebook). Wildfrost is way more difficult and punishing than the other games - which can be a good thing, if you're looking for a challenge.

One thing, I really wish, the game would offer a bit more, is a little more extended explanation how the game  and the game mechanics are working. There's a really short tutorial, but after that it is a constant trial and error. Some things are not explained at all.

Overall, I'm still looking forward to dive deeper into Wildfrost!","0.454545468091964722","1702733130","true","148","246","0","18","331","1","0","0"

Pretty good, game is pretty short though. You can beat the game WAY quicker than you can complete town quests, mostly because they are very specific. Not much incentive to go back and 100% unlock everything due to the short length of each run, so you don't really get to flesh out any op combos you manage to find. This game was pretty fun, but I will only suggest grabbing it on sale, $15 max imo. 

Also this game is not at all challenging if you've played a deck rogue before, just a couple gimmick enemy mechanics is all.","0.495008319616317749","1702538167","true","863","863","0","22","133","0","0","0"

If you're a roguelike deckbuilder veteran you're going to snore through the first run.  But like any good rogue it gets more interesting each time you play it.  There are ample opportunities to break the game, and just as many opportunities to be broken by the game.

I wish there were more options for build variety between fights, either by adding more paths or more events along the current dual path choice.

Turns out the game is a unity game with il2cpp enabled in all their builds meaning modding is needlessly difficult for little to no gain to the players, with the community repeatedly asking the developer to disable it or at least offer a separate build with it disabled, which he says he'll look into but never did for months and months. The game itself has a lot of potential, and my experience first time playing was incredible, just like with games like Slay the Spire or Balatro, but after a certain point feels like it's desperately missing content and balance (and not in the way a lot of other negative reviews say: it's not too punishing, losing your run to one tiny mistake is what makes clutching out a win with 1 hp left on your champion so satisfying), which makes picking the same cards which are handed to you almost every run always better than trying out different ones - some cards don't work well with all tribes, some cards lead to builds that almost cannot beat some certain enemies and some of them are just plain worse than other ones. There're many detailed community made balance ideas from players with a lot of experience in the game with really great suggestions, but it feels like they are mostly ignored by the developer, instead favoring short term balance patches that make the game easier to be more accessible to new players, but takes away some of what makes Wildfrost Wildfrost. For example, the enemy wave bell is a really bad change in my opinion, it makes stalling out weak enemies to reduce all the counters, than bringing out enemies only for them lose half their health a very boring and effective strategy.

Spoiler-free explanation: This game has what is effectively a compounding difficulty. Every time you successfully beat a run, your next run will be harder than the last. 

On top of this, the game is already difficult. Beating your first run in the first place will take a lot of time and learning of mechanics. I do wish there was more progression once you've completed a few runs, but it was certainly worth my money.

SPOILER EXPLANATION: the final boss... is you. past your first run, the final boss will be using the deck you used to beat your previous successful run. This results in a very odd dynamic where you have to know how to beat your own deck building. 

Now personally, i consider myself /good/ at roguelikes, and /better than average/ at card games. i really like roguelike deck-builders. I've bought a good amount of games, and have mastered most of them to the point of winning fairly easily.

This game is 100% the most challenging deckbuilders I've ever played, and it does it without it feeling unfair. You don't need some perfect storm of a deck to win. but you need to know how to build it, and a full knowledge of the mechanics.

If you are looking for an easier mindless deckbuilder, pick up Inscryption, or Slay the Spire, or Night of the Full Moon (which is free)

Auto-Card Battler done right. I wanted to branch out into other strategy card games after 200 hours in StS, so I picked up  Monster Train. Something about it just didn't catch my attention too much.

I however do not like it, makes me feel dumb. No matter how charming the tone I couldn't escape the feeling that playing it was work. This game requires patience and I like making fast spontaneous choices in games but doing so without a high IQ or established meta is heavily punished in this game.

A lot of the issues of the game have been addressed, its good to see the devs looking after the game and its community. Give the game a try.
 Look, don`t get me wrong, i wanted to like it, the art and the sound are a BLESSING, magical, the artstyle among deckbuilders is probably my favourite, better than StS and MT and many others and i had it on my wishlist for a long time.
But Jesus, its not that the game is difficult per se, its just that it is VERY poorly balanced, and even quite underwhelming.
Its not that it is unplayable or unbeatable, its just that with the amount of time i spent on deckbuilders and roguelike/lites, it feels frustrating in a bad way, not the ' Damn, almost had it!' its more like ' well, i didnt have much luck in the cards/build so this 2 next 2 enemy archetypes are basically unbeatable'.

Its the kind of rogue like that after looks amazing, but feels so underwhelming in many ways. 
The charms, for example are one, such amazing and nice mechanic, but in the end so poorly implemented. They are your upgrades, what makes your runs in Rogue 'crazy', different, and most of the times they are just useless or bad, not something to look foward or game changing even though they are essential.

i could say a lot more, but as the game is right now, it doesnt feel fun, its a shame.","0.495213061571121216","1681583702","true","541","2489","0","4","0","0","0","0"

It will keep on beating your hero's sorry face and make you feel stupid until you figure things out. And once you feel that you figured things out? Still doesn't get easier. It will still make you feel stupid for missing out the tiniest details just seconds after you commit to a turn. I love it.

If you're coming from Slay the Spire, Monster Train or Across the Obelisk, definitely pick this up.
If you've never played any of those three, and you were just enticed by how nice the game looks, please don't. You'll just hate it.

👍 UPDATE: Almost 10 hours in. I feel like I already have a good grasp of the mechanics and unit rotations. But dang man, this game really is very hard. It's like a mix of Monster Train and Into the Breach, somewhat.

👍 UPDATE: After 31 hours of the AI repeatedly wiping out my squad silly, I finally got a win. I don't know if I could pull off another win again. I know I have good game sense now, but I am in no way confident in what I am doing. Game is definitely harder than Into the Breach. It's my first win after 31 joyful hours of pain here - with ITB I got a handful of wins and I only have 20 total play hours there. Both are fun though. Pain.

👎 UPDATE: Game's last substantial update was way back late August this year. It is now December, and things have gotten stale. Sure, the game looks adorable, art is nice and all - but eventually that'll get old and people will look past the lovely aesthetics and will focus on the actual game underneath all the cute fluff. Right now, the number of valid builds is very limited. Most non-meta builds are glaringly ineffective, even to low/no-bell runs. This pales in comparison to Slay the Spire and Monster Train. The game needs a lot more cards, companions, heroes and status effects, and more build variety. Starting difficulty takes a while to get used to, but it's nice once you get the hang of it. Oh crap, I can't believe I'm downvoting this after 74 hours. Game needs a massive update. Downvoting for now.

This game has a lot going on for it that I like, and a few big things that I dislike the way they are now. Devs are responding to feedback for balance, features, etc. which is excellent, so don't let this review discourage you from buying this game. I highly recommend it in its current state and expect it to only get better from here.

Positives:
+ Art and soundtrack are very good
+ It's similar to games like Slay the Spire and Monster Train without feeling derivative of them
+ Its system of upgrades (charms) give a lot of control to the player and enable a lot of creative combos
+ Leader units are a cute idea that help keep runs fresh while encouraging variety in build path
+ Its focus on tactics / timing during combat is refreshing and well-done
+ The card effects are written and coded very clearly (reading the card explains the card)

Negatives:
- Not enough player choices while building your deck during a run
- Runs feel a bit short for my liking
- Certain effects let you snowball WAY too quickly (especially some of the achievement charms)
- Event RNG can leave you in a tough position in some cases
- Being unable to pass up rewards really feels bad (they partially address this with the ability to take and bench companions but you can't pass up treasure rewards)

You'll see people here complaining about game balance. There is no doubt that game balance needs to be worked on in some ways, but I think that balance is less about nerfing particular encounters/effects and more about encouraging variety of card choices for players. If you compare Wildfrost to Slay the Spire, a regular run in Slay the Spire has 50 floors. About 2/3rds of the floors lets you choose to add a card to your deck or [b]skip a reward[/b], and there are 55 floors in a [spoiler]Heart kill run[/spoiler]. Any floor that isn't a campfire is giving you something to help you win the run (a card reward, a relic, etc.), and the campfires are still doing something for your deck as well. Compared to the average of ~15-20ish total floors that give card choices in a Wildfrost run, it leaves it feeling a bit lacking and you also don't have as much time to find cards that support your strategy as you would in another game. A fairer comparison is to Monster Train, which has a similar feel to Wildfrost (and a lot of similar issues) but ultimately offers players around ~25-30 floors, card rewards after each combat, and the ability to accept a handicap during a normal encounter in exchange for a reward after clearing it. The player having more chances to build their deck a certain way gives the player more chance to make choices and try to build a run-winning deck.

Particular encounters and particular enemies can be solved for to a point even with the base decks, which helps a lot, but knowing that the pool of companions / treasures / charms along with the currently scripted enemy encounters only goes so deep unfortunately curbs the game a bit too. 

Let me finish by saying that I am a big deckbuilding roguelike enjoyer. I have a few thousand hours across the other two games I've played (STS and Monster Train), done numerous A20 heart kills, maxed covenant on Monster Train, and have also beaten the [spoiler]true final boss[/spoiler] of Wildfrost a few times so far. Wildfrost offers a unique experience AND it's charming in its own right. Give this game a try :)

These are some things that I think would help this game's playability a lot:
- More clearly labeling enemy units with charms on them (a special animation when entering, a different-colored card frame, a changed stat being highlighted in a different color, etc.)
- Hovering a card over a target potentially showing its effects on its targets (damage dealt, status effects applied, etc., which is arguably more important with action timing being a factor in this game)
- (Potentially) An additional set of events (card rewards / etc. + combat encounter) before each boss fight
- (Potentially) Adding a reward type of the player's choice after a combat encounter (e.g. the player can pick 'charm, treasure, companion' and get a fully random reward after defeating enemies)

A word of warning, don't get deceived by cute aesthetics the game is by no means casual. The gameplay is both deep and challenging, with no mistake going unpunished.
This is definitely my favourite release in 2023.

One of my favourite things about the design of this game, is that the rules are very simple. Every turn you can only play one card and then attacks occur. There is only maximum 6 cards on the player's side at a time, for a total of maximum 12 creatures in game total. The rest of the rules come from the keywords which are mostly very simple, but from here the complexity starts multiplying for effects from all creatures in game. Attack counters allow to plan many turns forward, everything together making for a very satisfying puzzle for those willing to bend their brain.

The difficulty of the game meant for me that I only progressed after spending significant time with game and learning how it works (the hard way). And a win was is not only a matter of a lucky run encountered a few attempts into the fun.

Finally the game has beautiful music and is extremely pleasant to interact with. I only wish it was working a little bit better with the touch screen on the Steam Deck as I really want to touch the assets. But the controller scheme is absolutely usable.

Wholeheartedly recommended for fans of difficult roguelike and/or card games who like to experiment with new builds/combos in following runs.","0","1701191554","true","1695","4020","0","8","0","0","0","0"

I love the music, I really love the presentation (just the way things recoil and physically react to attacks 'n stuff), the game has a lot of personality. I will say that this game's flow is pretty different than a lot of other deckbuilders and I think that catches a lot of people (myself included) off-guard.

However I think in return it does a lot to pave its own identity, both in the archetypes you're able to play and how you play them, and I think that also makes the game a lot harder from jump street than most others. At the same time, though, I think the most recent large update did a lot to alleviate this, particularly with the change that you can choose an archetype (called Tribes) and then, in doing so, be presented with 3 Leaders as opposed to before where you were presented with three leaders from 3 different tribes and just had to roll with which one had the best ability or gamble on whether the leader from the tribe you wanted to pick could survive very long. They usually wouldn't.

I'm honestly not going into a whole lot of detail here because I feel like the gameplay vids and the much larger reviews do that well enough, but my entire point is simply that this feels similar but it's not Slay the Spire. It's not Monster Train or whatever else your mind might first think of when you see it. A really lucky, well constructed run in this will feel [i]way[/i] different in this than its peers and the agency of the player to focus on positioning and priority from moment to moment (aside from just building the deck itself) plays a huge part in that.

And it's crazy satisfying when you win, this game's so addictive.

P.S. To the devs, PLEASE add a function to lock nicknames. Nicknaming cards is one of my favorite features but having to do it every single run makes it kinda lose its novelty, at least if you decided to do it for every single run. Would be great if at least for some cards we could lock them so they persist between runs, or at least get cataloged somehow.","0.719526350498199463","1701190248","true","2212","2214","0","51","0","20","0","0"

Before I do get into that, believe me, I have my reasoning, and whether or not you should play the game, you will understand soon enough.

Wildfrost is Extremely, UNFORGIVING, and hella complicated game. Do not let it's cute style and byutiful art decieve you, there is no room for mistakes in this game. And that is why I feel like it failed. It's main art would have you believe this game is easier than stuff like Slay The Spire, meanwhile being total opposite. Slay The Spire despite it's looks is very simple and heck of a fun. Wildfrost is watching your every move, looking for tiniest mistake to smash you in the face with Game Over Message. 

The Amount of Mechanics you have to learn is Overwhelming, The Unlocks to help in runs are Underwhelming, Simple mechanics are made impossible to understand, and you never feel powerful. You are always in the brink of losing the game even on a God Run.

This is not a game for the first time players, The Learning curve even from beginning is a Wall 20 foot tall, and the Difficulty never stays below: You are about to die.
And While it may be bit wrong- I recommend First Playing Slay The Spire, so that you can understand first what Card Game Rougelikes are, so that later on you might return to this game, and not get completely mauled by difficulty of this game.

But if you played Slay The Spire, Really Like Rougelikes and Card games- this is the game to punch you in the gut.","0.444875776767730713","1701174185","false","764","804","0","8","0","2","1","1"

It is 95% luck needed in this game as you can get screwed over not only with the selection of cards, companions, and trinkets, and character abilities, but if you just happen to go up against a specific set of bosses, you are doomed to failure.
There are legitimately at least 5 bosses in this game that have extremely overpowered setups and if you encounter them too early in the run or get screwed over a million other possible ways, then you are guaranteed to die and have to start over.
This wouldn't be bad if their spawn rate was more balanced, but you can seriously get wiped out at the very first fight if you don't choose very specific builds and play styles, which makes the whole RNG aspect nothing more than a headache since you either get the run that will let you even have a chance at winning, or you don't.

Very little skill required to win, almost entirely just luck of the draw.","0.485388875007629395","1701145720","false","418","418","0","28","0","7","1","0"

This game is super satisfying when you get a good build and go all the way with it, and even more so when you get one that's not that good and make it work.
It almost always feels possible, and very rarely feels like the game cheated you of your victory. I've won runs with some bad luck and lost runs where I felt set up for success, and 9 times out of 10 it's because I messed up.
My advice if you're just about to start playing: don't get hung up on not winning/getting super far for a while, this game's far from easy so try to step back and learn the game.

Love the game and I will forever miss the turn zero cheese.

Wildfrost is to Monster Train, what Monster Train was to Slay to Spire: A brilliant creation that builds on many of the beloved mechanics whilst proudly standing alone as a fantastic title in itself. Here, the focus is even more on your creatures on the board... pushing further into the importance of formations and timing.

Whilst you play your turns, each character on the board also has their own turn counter (rather than all acting at the end of every turn). It has a fun auto-battler feel whilst very much keeping you in full control: You can recall companions or move them around your side of the board (critical in sweet combos or shielding people from damage) and help with action cards of your own. Whilst it can sound a bit much, it's very easy to get to grips with... yet the subtle nuances of formations, timing, recalls and redraws give this game the kind of sublime tactical depth that I loved in Into the Breach. For example, your hand doesn't discard at the end of each turn. You either play X turns before you can re-draw up for free, or spend a turn to immediately do so... and the latter is more important than it may sound at first.

The difficulty makes for a solid and satisfying challenge once you're up to speed, and seems to keep the RNG nicely in check - even in spite of some dud items. However, the lack of difficulty variation does mean that it can feel a bit brutal whilst you're finding your feet. On the whole though, I'd say the difficulty feels more consistent than its counterparts: Ranging from 'tight win' to 'awe-inspiring steamroll'... even if it does chuck you in at the deep end.

Additionally, the game is just plain gorgeous. The visuals are delightful and the design is charmingly fun, tongue-in-cheek and fresh: Both for your folks and the bad guys. The OST is also possibly one of the most cleverly creative works I've heard in ages... I can only describe it as 'Wintry Tribal / Nepalese'. It sets the scene perfectly and the boss level music is pumping enough to make those fights very exciting.

Don't be fooled by the cutesy exterior, this deck-building rouge-like requires a lot of mental gymnastics and is NOT appropriate for children. If you enjoy calculating optimal outcomes in tactical combat, you're in for a unique treat. Otherwise, stay away.

-----

Wildfrost is one of the first games in a long series of Slay-the-Spire-likes (StS) that has finally finally made it's own unique mark on the genre. Yes, it's a deck building card battler rouge-like. But the way Wildfrost handles resources are so very different that it deserves praise. Now if only it were not so difficult to get into...

In the first twenty or so games I played, I won maybe 3 times. I seem to have finally gotten the hang of it, and now I'm on a winning streak on harder difficulties. I've seen a streamer with a win streak of 71.

What I'm trying to get at here is how difficult the game can be at the start, but eventually can be won consistently when mastered. 

It's not like the mechanics are obtuse or the RNG is harsh. It's just that there is *so* much going on that there's to many factors to juggle. Unlike StS, you're controlling a team of up to 6 units on the field at once and the enemy side also numbers up to 6. And enemies can have all sorts of weird mechanics to keep the fight 'interesting'. What often happens is I'll forget to account for specific mechanics and thus doom the run. The game is pretty unforgiving.

TIP: The mechanics that tend to be forgotten most often are Barrage, Aimless, Smackback and Thorns. Watch out for these in particular and you'll be mostly fine.

Once you get used to it though, well, consider the 71 win streak player. Not many players will take the time to master the game, which is a shame as Wildfrost has a lot to offer for players seeking a mental challenge.","0.642347991466522217","1688481096","true","1452","6486","0","48","0","16","1","2"

It just oozes charm and personality with beautiful well drawn art and lovely music. The tutorial introduces the game mechanics well and what I also really love is that progression is achieved through completing a variety of challenges, leading to your home city to develop and improve as you complete runs. It feels far more engaging to unlock new things this way rather than the traditional XP levels unlock system.

The way the game plays is a bit different from most other deckbuilder roguelikes. Your deck consists of a hero whom you must deploy at the beginning of a fight (and must be kept alive or you lose the game), a limited number of companions, and then a number of spells/traps/items/etc. You are fighting against a group of enemies that deploy onto the field and they will get timed reinforcements as well. There are two lanes of combat and each character on the field has a countdown timer before they attack. Each turn you can play one card from your hand only (there are no mana pools or anything like that) and playing a card will lead to the countdowns progressing and characters to attack if they are ready. You can strategically choose when to discard your hand and draw a new one, and you can also strategically bring enemy reinforcements on to the field early if it’s a good time to do so. Of all the roguelike deckbuilders I’ve played I would say this game most closely resembles Monster Train but is still quite different from that.

Overall, the game is hard, but you have a lot of agency in how you develop your deck. I’ve only played a few runs so far but none of the losses felt unfair. The game has been a joy to play. Highly recommended.","0","1700955311","true","194","2626","0","33","0","0","0","2"

There were some problems initially during the release but they did a great job improving many aspects.

1. The choice between three members of each tribe has greatly improved as there is more variety and some of the leader choices can lead to more interesting gameplay
2. The art and style of the game is just amazing, combined with the music which matches perfectly.
3. There is a lot of variety and builds you can try.

Unlike other deck-based roguelikes, this this game really lets you *consistently* flex your synergies to a high degree. It has a similar feel to The Binding of Isaac where you can skill-diff your way out of most situations, but the game is at its best when you're accomplishing synergies and getting large, but consistent, power bumps. That is, there is a middle-of-the-road skill floor -- you're liable to win the base game on your first few attempts if you know what you're doing -- but a high skill ceiling where you're only able to truly succeed by mastering the turn-to-turn, node-to-node, and run-to-run gameplay.

Of note as well are the incredible visuals, animations, and great soundtrack.

Now that the game is fully released, I amend this rating to be 13.5/10. The art style is absolutely [i]delicious[/i] and the gameplay is downright [i]delightful[/i]. And the characters and card art? Adorable. The animations? Buttery. The audio? Magical. The lore? Spectacular. And don't you dare think for a second, 'Oh, I've played other deck builders so this one can't be that different, right?.' WRONG. I have sunk over 600 hours into Slay the Spire and the only similarities between the two games are that they are deck builders. The game mechanics for Wildfrost are unique, and there are so many different card combinations and synergies in this game that each run is wildly different than the last. Needless to say, I am looking forward to sinking over 600 hours into Wildfrost as well.

EDIT: I now have over 300 hours in the game and I can confirm it is a blast and a half.","0.501354992389678955","1681322953","true","204","26787","0","8","0","1","0","0"

I'm close to not recommending. It's difficult which is cool, there is a mechanic where the boss of the next run is your character from the previous run that I feel like is extremely out of place and ruins the fun of the game for me.

The reason is that I personally play Roguelike Deckbuilders after the first clear is for the thrill of having the God-run, where your character gets stupidly strong and you draft all the right goodies.

Unfortunately, this is the first game I've played where the game actively punishes you in a future playthrough for your success in a previous one where the boss of the next run is the hero of your current run.

This awful mechanic completely ruins any replay ability in the game for me, because instead of feeling attached to my hero and wanting to make it stronger, after the 'wow' factor of the first 2 playthroughs where I fight my own dude, I now treat my own hero as an enemy, actively trying to make sure it's weak and easy for future runs.

After clearing 3 runs I stopped playing, so I definitely didn't get my money's worth and this is a rather weak title in my library as a result.

But the time I did manage to play the game it was amazing and creative, the sound design, art card design are all on point.

Here's to hoping for a mod or an update that turns this god awful feature off so you don't get rewarded for hurting your own heroes.","0","1700810344","true","250","250","0","26","216","0","0","0"

~ts addictive, I've played for 19hrs now off and on and I've never even beaten a run. 
~Many different tropes to speck into
~Daily climb is fun

Cons:
~ GAME IS SO HARD. Fortune rarely favors the bold and you will be clobbered if you don't think your build out. 
~ Can get repetitive if you constantly go the same route. (there are 3 diff factions to choose from, but many tropes to get into from those factions keeping it fresh)
~Town feels a bit pointless, I wish there were upgrades you could purchase to give a new dimension to the game. 

All in all, its a wonderful take on a deck-builder & I highly recommend!

Of course, the game is difficult, and often encourages you to use items to their full potential, with some cards that benefit you if you hurt yourself with them also being able to wipe out hordes of weak enemies if used correctly, while others allowing you to activate synergistic abilities by hitting yourself with your own swords. Super engaging, with that bit of broken building that roguelites tend to have while still being able to keep your mind on edge. My 28% winrate can attest to how hard this game is at all times, even in my 80 hours it can be a struggle to make it past the first zone, and this is what makes every victory feel so good. If you love overcoming challenges, this is definitely a must-try.

Edit: really hoping this wins hard game of the year, its really fun to overcome challenges in this game, it even managed to make the great Northernlion (slay the spire master) ragequit because of how tough it is, but ive found time and time again that its just so fun to learn how to deal with everything and overcome all of the struggles that this game presents.","0.529914498329162598","1697663701","true","4810","8347","0","14","38","3","0","0"

Punishing but yet for some reason you just can't look away and want to keep going after each defeat.

My only gripe is that Wildforst can hugely benefit from some sort of lore/world building, but aside from that as far as card battlers go i definitely enjoyed every moment of it.","0","1700672548","true","1218","1241","0","10","0","0","0","0"

My experience with it seems very similar to Monster Train. Some runs are free, while others are completely miserable. Those games can't really compete with Slay the Spire for that reason. 

With that said, I still think Wildfrost is fun and worth your time, just don't expect it to be as good as Slay the Spire.

Honestly it's not a hard game if you just read the cards and use your brain. I know it isn't Fortnite but it's not rocket science. 10 runs in I've beaten the 1st boss 8 times and the 2nd 4 or 5.

This game is amazing in every aspect of game design, execution, music, artwork, animation, mechanics, the little details. It's fantastic. Honestly one of the most well put together games I've played in a decade.

PLAY THIS GAME! Don't get scared by a bunch of smooth brained idiots that can't read.

Its so depressing when you get useless- charms. Building an entire class based on creating more- excessive cards(thejunk masters)- which bogs down the entire deck building system is just not a good idea. 

There is no way to trim down your deck at all. No matter how good of a strategist you are- the card and charms are way too random to create effective play synergy. So 90% of your game is up to chance/luck. and i would say 1/25 play thorough is actually satisfying. Getting to the higher level items/unlocks is soo grindy. I've played 25 hrs and only gotten to 10% of the unlocks. Serious the curve is too high and i have no incentive to play anymore because its just chance. 

Many of the strategies don't mix with each other. I'm sad because it looks like it had so much potential. 
The advice in strategy- is showing you how to break the system- instead of actually just fixing the the complete randomness of item drops/and card/ ally distribution for more fun gameplay.","0.455415785312652588","1698733757","false","1521","3807","0","3","0","5","1","0"

I had it installed on almost ever device on every floor of my home and I spent hours on even streaming it to my phone. The aesthetics are really charming and the mechanics of the game are great. I have not played a tactics/deck-building game that is as well executed as this. 

A common complaint seems to be the difficulty of the game but as someone that 'completed' the game before the waves of difficulty patches came in, the reason why this game stuck with me for so long was the mastery it required. I had to understand what encounters that would instantly counter my deck and constantly have those checks throughout runs. It felt satisfying to go from barely able to progress to more consistently make it to the end. 

My only complaint about the game is the lack (major) content post launch. I see that there are regular patches that have come out but much of it seems more geared towards QOL and the new-player experience (difficulty). I have not launched the game in months because there hasn't been a reason for me to get back into the game.","0.566929101943969727","1698180238","true","3633","5212","0","9","0","4","0","0"

One of my favourite roguelikes ever!

Some sharp edges have been improved since the game released and I like the game even more now!

Some things I still wish they’d improve:
- Previews when adding charms to cards. There are so many combinations that even if I’ve played the game a lot I still can’t always predict how/if certain combinations will work. And when you’re in a tight run it feels really bad to throw it away just beacuse you wasted money on something that didn’t work.
- I wish effects had some more clearly visible visual effect on cards so you remember them more easily. It is easy to miss a Aimless at the bottom of a card with lots of other effects and then just lose a run because you didn’t do another complete scan of all the cards. It just makes the game a bit slow sometimes. Smackback and barrage etc could also have more clear visual signs so it is impossible to miss/forget that info.
- They have rebalanced it but I never thought it was a very fun mechanic to get more money for getting bigger combos, it just slows down the game and makes some builds worse because they’re not as good at making combos.

Overall I love the game though and hope they continue to improve it and add many dlcs for even more variety! 🙂","0.525862038135528564","1697668205","true","3830","7146","0","4","0","2","0","0"

However, once you grasp the intricacies of the turn mechanics and master deck manipulation, you'll realize the true brilliance of this game.

The gameplay is all about combos and synergy. When everything aligns, the feeling is absolutely exhilarating. It's crucial to recognize and adapt to your weaknesses:

Do you often deal multiple low-damage attacks? Then you should watch out for teeth.
Do you prefer a single, high-damage blow? Stay alert for blocks and be wary of scrappy.
Crafting the perfect combo while covering your vulnerabilities is the key to success. And as a delightful bonus, the art is so enchantingly charming that I'm genuinely hoping for some plushies.

The UI, art, fluidity are all perfect. The game flows well, there's minimum waste time, and generally it ticks the boxes for 'deck builder rogue like.' 

Unfortunately that kind of game will always get compared to STS, and it falls short in so many ways there. Whether you do or do not like the 'RNG' aspect, the truth is there's no sense of truly earning the win on a run. You either have the right build or you do not, you obliterate the enemy or you get obliterated. And that's mostly dependent on 3 things: snow, crowns, and multi attacks. You can forget everything else, these are far and away the strongest things to use in the game.

I'm not very compelled to keep playing after a successful run, the gimmick of fighting your winning team is cute and unique but personally I feel like it backfires.... I don't want to face my team, that means I need to build for that fight from the beginning of a run.

I appreciate the devs continuing to work on it, and maybe it'll get there. For me though, still chasing that STS dragon.","0.555131077766418457","1697311912","false","1337","1337","0","10","0","20","2","0"

The music and art are amazing, and to a quality I haven't seen from many games. In game mechanics are actually intriguing and original. I think many people are putting the thumbs down to the fact that it's difficult and a small part luck based, but aren't all rogue likes? The dev team is also only two people large and  have expressed that they are probably going to add more content and tweak things for balance. It's a brand new game and very immersive, I don't think it deserves anything less than a very positive score.

Before my reasons as to why I do want to say it is a fun proof of concept and has a ton of potential and if all you want is to support the developers and have a solid 10 or so hours of fun then you should definitely pick it up.

The core problems with the game (in my opinion) are a lack of variety in enemy strategies and how heavily that is influenced by health and power values of both your cards and enemy cards.

Most strategies the enemies use appear varied but almost all boil down to doing a lot of damage all at once and/or denying the strongest easily available strategies to the player. 

Starting with the pure damage strategies most of these either use one unit that hits very hard or several times usually with some sort of scaling to damage or number of attacks. There are outliers  use several damaging units but these are usually supplemented with a boss unit with either Barrage (hits all units in the opposing row) or multiple attacks upon being triggered. Inherently these strategies are not an issue but there is such a density of them that it feels samey after you've won your first couple runs; this issue is compounded by the early game encounters being almost entirely complete pushovers.
As for the denial strategies these vary wildly depending on the strategy your using either being a complete joke or hard countering your entire composition with the only counterplay being foresight of them. Specific examples for this one would be a group of crabs that spawn with large amounts of shield (Each charge of which cancels one instance of damage) and a group of cat units that apply Aimless (unit attacks a random unit in the enemy row) and units which have Thorns (Deals damage to attacker equal to amount). Each of these counters opposing strategies the crabs counter building tall while the cats counter going wide/multi attacks; each of which being the most prevalent strategies available to the player without modifiers being applied by the player to their cards through either charms or bells. The best way to counter these is to diversify your deck adding cards with more narrow use cases and a combination of both of the main damage dealing strategies available to the player. These are by far my favorite encounter type because of how they force you to diversify.

The biggest issues with both of these arise with how these strategies are distributed throughout a run.
Early game to mid game is dominated by damage based encounters that require consistently high damage to beat whereas the late game is heavily skewed towards denial strategies.
Taking cards that will help in the late game means you will most likely not have the damage for the early game encounters but if you focus on your damage you will lose if you encounter a denial strategy that your core cards have a bad matchup against.
Cards that care about building large damage on one creature do not mix well with a board full of smaller units. This amounts to the best non combo strategy being one large multi attacking creature supplemented with one or two support units to stall, remove, or otherwise invalidate the enemies units wholesale. The only real way the game punishes you for this is the injury system.
If one of your units dies in an encounter they will have both their damage and health halved in the next combat this is referred to as an injured unit. The health can be healed by putting the unit back into your deck from the board restoring 6 health each time you do this or cards that provide healing. Damage however cannot be regained without very specific cards making having your main damaging unit ever getting an injury past the early game almost certainly a loss if you're building tall. At the same time you have your leader unit which will always be nothing but a hindrance, you don't want to block with it since if it dies you lose and you don't want to rely on attacking with it in fear of encountering a denial strategy that will kill them the first time they attack. So you have at least two units you have to protect from any damage at all in the mid to late game. Having more than these two units to protect is nearly impossible without focusing almost entirely on defensive cards from this the majority of winning decks will have at their core one carry unit, one tank, and a support unit that will more often than not be on board for one turn at a time, unfortunately accompanied by your handicap of a 'leader'. Due to this the only leaders you ever want to pick have extremely high countdown timers and preferably a lot of health.

I could go on for quite a while listing shortcomings but I feel these are the core problems with the game.
Also i feel i should state the game isn't hard the only thing it ever requires is trial and error.

In short do the same things every run or lose, after 10 or so hours I was just going through the motions while i watched youtube on my other monitor.","0.673707246780395508","1696591791","false","2442","2442","0","18","0","59","3","6"

It looks like a cute game of strategy, but it's actually haha gotcha--you're dead! Over and over.

'Okay, so I look at the middle of the card for the turn timer--HAA GOTCHA! WE MOVE THAT ICON SOMETIMES!'

'This card has the same name, icon, and effect as the one I've been using for an hour--HAAA GOTCHA! DIFFERENT CARD, THIS ONE KILLS YOUR CHARACTER :D'

'I know this icon, it does this effect--HAAA GOTCHA! ITS THREE SHADES DIFFERENT AND DOES SOMETHING ELSE!'

When your game is based around tracking up to twelve things with different turn timers, you cannot relocate the turn timer for them every turn. When your game is based on parsing huge amounts of information, you can't make things identical. That's literally the only issue with this game. But if they didn't catch that, then they don't have even basic QA. So I'd imagine my experience with this game in the future would continue to be, 'Whoops we didn't QA that--I mean, GOTCHA!!!'

update: I mean, the game is lovely cute in lots of ways. and the devs are lovely and active. but that doesn't change that it's the dark souls of card games, except a roguelike that doesn't actually give you time to review your mistakes, which are often due to really minor oversights. so if you like being gaslit and reviewing your stream. ^-^'","0.431868016719818115","1691895779","false","215","1596","0","4","0","2","3","0"

Wildfrost was an adorable game packed with horrendous consequences if you hadn't considered every angle of your deck and the enemies to come.
Every improvement on a card can also be a detriment depending on the battles you face, and I thought that was just such a wonderful idea. I've had thousands and THOUSANDS of hours in Slay the Spire, and this was a fresh take on a quickly-approaching over-saturation of card battlers/roguelikes.
There have been quite a few updates since launch, improving a lot of quality of life items. Deadpan very obviously listened to their community and made a lot of changes that allowed you extra relics upon defeating bosses, gave you three times as many characters to choose from to start... etc.
I'm fully aware that I may be an outlier, but I just have to say... the brain-shattering difficulty that came with the original release was phenomenal, and I'd love a way to revisit that. It was so much more rewarding to finally face and defeat that final boss after being patient with my relic placements... Now I'm facing the last boss with nearly every single run with all three of the detriment relics on.

But how could I give a thumbs down for a game that, since release, has become much more for the broad audience it deserves? Perhaps it's the amount of time I played the game that made it stupid easy.

The art style is great and a lot of the card abilities feel fresh. My biggest issue is that it is super punishing and very difficult to win. I'm sure some will say its easy and you just have to learn the right play style, but deck-builders IMO are best when multiple play styles are viable. One wrong play or forgetting to move a character before playing a card is game over. People will say 'get good', but to quote another reviewer/player 'the base game difficulty is like starting Slay the Spire at Ascension 10'. 
I really want to keep playing this game and win a run in the future, but the difficulty can and probably will deter more casual deck-builder game fans. Here's to hoping the Devs implement a difficulty scaling option in the future.

And the amount of care put into the aesthetic, music and sound design - the way every encounter has a unique jingle when a miniboss appears especially. There's a lot to love here, give it a chance to learn what's going on and have a blast.

This game has tons of elements that really make it stand out above the crowd, and it does a lot of things in a fresh manner that make it seem a rather promising title, if the proper care is put into it.

EDIT: Since the latest update, it became clear that the development team has both the intent to put more effort into this game and skill and shape it in a great direction. Between bug fixes, visual and HUD changes, and a massive amount of balance and quality of life adjustments, Wildfrost gameplay's polish now mirrors its visual one. From the very start of a run up to the final combat, everything has gotten polished, and even small changes address some of Wildfrost's most frustrating elements, keeping a meaningful challenge while shifting power and agency into the player's hands. Wildfrost is now a fresh, engaging and fun deckbuilder that manages to balance challenging gameplay with great visuals, an amazing soundtrack and unique mechanics. It's a great experience and completely detached from the launch state, and, like I said in my original review: A very promising title and definitely worth picking up, especially with aditional updates on the horizon. I'm leaving the original review up for transparency's sake, by the way.

OUTDATED: Despite all this, at around 20 runs and 3 hours in, it has become clear that the balancing is abysmal. On my first few runs I just brushed it off to being new at the game, but after dying to the first battle in the campaign the first couple of times I figured something was way off, and it seems like this is a common issue to those that have already played the game. Even 
some positive reviews list it as an unbalanced mess.

Enemies are numerous and extremely punishing. I enjoy having certain 'factions' of foes, each possessing varying abilities and passives. You have enemies that focus on shielding themselves, enemies that use their hp as attack value and enemies that focus on debuffing. That being said, each enemy type requires you to have a certain 'answer' to their skillset, which becomes a frustrating element of the game when you have such limited options to expand your deck and absolutely no way of knowing which enemies you'll end up facing. Got a build that focuses on attacking?  Too bad, for the next fight you'll be pitted against thorned enemies. Oh well, better luck next time. Having fights test the player's deck in different aspects is a great way of keeping the gameplay fresh but this is a ludicrous way of doing so. 

Let's also talk about the wave system in battles. The counter ticks down every turn to punish the player for stalling out fights which is a cool way of keeping combat fluid and engaging, but defeating enemies before the timer runs out just causes instant reinforcements anyway. With that in mind, the player's choice is between 1. Dragging out combat in an attempt to scale your team to face the army of threats aproaching and 2. Rushing the enemies to try and defeat most of them before you get overwhelmed. Not exactly a good way to reward quickly disposing of enemies since you get fucked over for doing so anyway.

Heroes being randomized was something that caught my eye when watching people playing the demo. After playing for a while, though, I wish they had stuck to a more basic approach instead of this messy implementation. Most heroes are delightfully useless, and serve more as a burden than anything else, since you're obligated to put them on the board. If you get unlucky enough with your draw, you might end up just dying outright to the first battle, before you even get a chance to modify your deck, which, albeit hilarious, is pretty bad from a balancing perspective.

The timer on actions was also a fun mechanic to mess around with and explore when I was starting out. However, this means action economy is terribly unbalanced (just as many, many other aspects of this game's combat). The mana system used in most modern deckbuilders triumphs greatly over Wildfrost's take, here, when it becomes painstakingly difficult to keep up with enemies when the players' actions are both costly and widely uninpactful. 

It seems wildfrost is trying to place itself as a challenging game, which I enjoy greatly, but there's also this feeling that the game is afraid of giving the player any agency. You have no reroll options, no chance to pass up a companion or an item (that I encountered in my short time playing) that'll bloat your deck or be left to gather dust in the reserve, and it makes me scratch my head and ask: 'why?'

Companions themselves (and heroes, for that matter) are largely designed to be brittle and fragile, as to make positioning and delaying enemy actions (or killing them outright before they even get a chance to act) important, but at the same time, the game makes them widely meek compared to enemies. You have heroes with whopping 7 cooldown triggers that dont even deal direct damage. You have pets, which are unique to the start of the game, occupying a slot that could be used for a companion later, which actively encourage you to trash them when you get better units.

 Most synergies that don't work instantly with your starter hero will be disappointing until more companions and items are in your deck (if you even survive to that point) that fit that particular role, and you're not even guaranteed to get any. Add this to the fact that you have a measly 2 slots for companions before you have to replace some, and also that you're not even guaranteed heroes that'll sinergize with anything and things will start to look bleak before you even start a run.

I could go on and on. Wildfrost's current state in balancing is apalling. I would ask for a refund if I could. I encourage anyone reading this to either skip completely or wait for a heavy discount. Of course, I'll edit this if things change, but even if I'm being optimistic, there's a lot, and I mean [b] a lot [/b], of work to be put in this game before I'd recommend it.","0.615402936935424805","1681352314","true","206","1893","0","2","0","0","0","65"

**Its a hard game. The tactical positioning of the units adds a whole new level of strategy to the tired copies of card based rougelikes. The same fights every run limits the replay value however.

I'm careful in that description of the game because it wouldn't be fair to say it misinforms the player, or even that it withholds information. All the information is there; how much damage the enemies will do, when they'll trigger, and the effects that will influence the battlefield.

My issue is just that the bulk of gameplay in this game comes down to scraping the screen between every card play to check if you've missed anything. It might sound weird to give a game a negative review based solely on this, but understand this game is designed so that every small card played has a huge impact, as it progresses the actions on the whole battlefield.

There is no indicator, or way to intuitively check, how much damage a unit will take, or if your unit is currently set to die when the battlefield progresses. An enemy will die and buff another enemy which will put one of your units into lethal range, or one of your allies will trigger before another due to an effect you forgot about and will attack into a counterattacking unit and die.

There's also no way to undo - this is logical as every card progresses the entire field, so it would be an unfair advantage. But it exacerbates this issue of needing to scour every detail every turn.

This is not unfair, nor is it even that hard; I won my first run out the gate. It's just not fun. Solving problems you're presented with is fun, and IN MODERATION, discovering those problems yourself can also be fun. But this is not in moderation, the massive bulk of the game is working out what's even going to happen on the field.

It quickly becomes both a chore and a dance on a razor's edge as you spend more time wondering if you've checked the field correctly than wondering what the best play is.

In the long run, this game could be absolutely fantastic with either changes to player information provided or mods to the same effect. But as it currently stands, this beautifully crafted game feels more like a second job.

I went from being unable to win a round after several hours of play and over 40 failed runs to consistently being able to win and while some of this is due to my familiarity with the game and mechanics, it is obvious to me that the bulk of the reason is that I have more options, better gold generation, and easier difficulty in general - Frankly the game is substantially improved in most aspects. Its not perfect, you still have repetitive design and some obfuscated mechanics, but in general - If your into card games, I think its a worth a purchase at this point. Props to the dev team for making it right for us 'mere mortals' at card games. Cheers.

*Original Review below:*
I just can't get over the difficulty curve, and I'm speaking as a veteran of Roguelike games and Tactical Card Games / Deckbuilders, from something like Gwent to Slay the Spire - you name it. There is a lack of player agency and a lot of your win-rate is determined on luck of the draw more than anything else. While I do enjoy some of the mechanics and the art style is bonkers good, the design is bad in a way that makes you feel like you'd have failed no matter how perfectly you played. You can luck into insane synergy or exploit bugs, but until this difficulty matches card game difficulty for mere mortals, I'd suggest a strong pass on this.","0.515895724296569824","1686347931","true","510","1394","0","4","0","0","0","1"

In my experience, much, MUCH easier to lose a run to bad luck than any other deck builder I've played. Say you pick a leader that applies Overburn but does no damage, and decide to go for an Overburn based run: you could take every route that offers you more character cards to draw from, and never find a character that works with that. OR, you might find both Overburn characters at the same time, but are only able to pick one: congratulations, you are guaranteed to not get the other! You essentially have a useless leader now.

But the game is beautifully polished, has great music and sound design, and very well thought out systems. When things DO work out, it is immensely satisfying. And once you have a good grasp of the game's mechanics, you can find yourself building an incredibly powerful strategy - once again, assuming RNG doesn't completely screw you over. And since there are relatively few chances to gain cards/charms/characters in a run, it is EXTREMELY easy to get screwed over, or for one bad choice to end an otherwise amazing run.

I've been so close to leaving a negative review countless times on this game. But ultimately, I keep saying 'maybe one more run?' and picking it back up. Maybe you will, too.","0","1694786513","true","2467","3456","0","2","0","0","0","0"

The game is punishing, but with recent changes it is FAR more playable and strategic. In older versions of the game, you really needed good RNG, but now it's far more in your hands.

2nd review...
Changing my review to negative:
1) Punished far too severely early in the run
2) Most bosses are a deck check... in game that doesn't allow building a deck
3) Rogue-lite progression gates useful items... achievements impossible to unlock because the game doesn't allow building a deck
4) Some generalized utility cards massively outclass specialized cards... because you can't build a deck to use the specialized cards
5) RNG is king

1st review...
- 10 hour learning curve to get reasonably competent at the game
- Really deep after that
- Far too restrictive in allowing you to craft a deck you want
- some enemies outrageously OP without specific counters in your deck","0.50127875804901123","1684318277","true","884","3612","0","27","251","0","0","1"

Extremely polished game, with very well done mechanics

There's always a new combo you can do
As you progress, it adds new cards, new status, new events, new enemies, as well as whole new 'tribes' that change the game considerably
The love put into it is very clear and it pays off

It's a very challenging game and you will make tons of stupid mistakes
Even more so due to its RNG, quite harsh in that regards, especially later on with more cards
But the runs are not long enough to make it too frustrating, and most of the time you either find out a combo that works or lose straight away

If you have lots of gaming experience and *really* like both deckbuilders and turn based tactics games, you'll find this one to be charming, unique, and fun.

But, like many of my recommendations, this one comes with a caveat. In wildfrost's case, the difficulty balance... could use some work.

The higher difficulty levels in particular feel as though they're balanced around the shademancer clan - a clan which becomes outrageously powerful with great regularity. Playing shademancer feels like... do you remember that one season of path of exile where the meta was a necromancy build, and you'd just cover the screen with dudes and they'd do all the work? Yeah, it's like that.

In stunning contrast, playing the clunkmaster clan - even on the lowest difficulty - is rather akin to torture. The Trash keyword in particular feels like a sick joke, with many of the clan's cards polluting your deck with junk cards that are, more often than not, worse than useless. On the flip side, many of the Recycle cards (which need junk cards in hand in order to play them) would be lackluster cards even if you *didn't* need to have a hand full of garbage to play them. Playing clunkmaster feels like... being Zangief and getting matched up against JP in street fighter 6.

All of that said, if you don't mind games where the pendulum of difficulty swings *wildly* from one extreme to the other depending primarily on the first choice you make each run, you'll probably still love this game.","0","1693815953","true","1626","3461","0","17","1353","0","0","0"

The visuals and game feel are super polished. The game is beautiful and full of charm, from the art to the sound effects. In terms of art style, it’s going for a cutesy vibe, with the names for enemies and cards to match (e.g. there is a boss named “Bamboozle”, which splits into 2 smaller enemies “Bam” and “Boozle”, which is absolutely charming). I also appreciate the references to other indie games.

Unlike other deckbuilders, Wildfrost plays a lot differently than Slay the Spire. A highlight for me is the charm system, little modifiers you can add to each card. Getting the right charms on certain cards is what really enables your combos.

In terms of difficulty, I think Wildfrost is reasonable. The first win should not take too much. It gets super difficult for the credits roll ending, however. It is satisfying once you manage to do it though. To compare it to Slay the Spire [spoiler] the Heart in Slay the Spire is easier, as you usually are pretty well equipped if you manage to get that far. Wildfrost’s final encounter is way more difficult, but the journey towards the end is easier. [/spoiler]

I was going to have a section in the review lamenting the lack of certain quality of life features, but an update came in and solved it (along with some other interesting tweaks). It is really easy to make a mistake and miss a keyword on an enemy, but they added some extra UI in the latest update when hovering over units.","0.6156044602394104","1693660036","true","2717","2743","0","56","0","8","0","0"

I've played 17 hours and haven't won a single time, but a good amount of my losses were due to bad decisions on my part through the run stacking up over time.

[strike]My one complaint is this:
The more you unlock through achievements during your playthroughs, the more difficult the game will be due to inconsistency - For example, when you play for the first time, you only have 1 faction available, and get to choose your leader at the start from 3 semi-random characters based on their attributes. After unlocking the 2 other factions, you still only get 3 picks - though now, they each are from a unique faction, each with their own deck that may or may not synergize well with that leader.

In a future update, it'd be nice to be able to toggle factions on or off depending on what you want to use in the hub, or refresh your list of 3 with the click of a button instead of having to pick one and throw the first battle if none of the choices are appealing.[/strike]   [b]You can now choose between 9 leaders - 3 for each faction - as of the 1.0.6 update. This is a great middle-ground, allowing players to choose their faction but still limiting their choices to what's available - it pushes players to try out other factions when they get a bad set of their favorite.[/b]

That aside, it's still super fun and addictive, and if you need to set the game aside in the middle of a run it saves your run for you - and gives you the option when opening the game again to continue or not [strike](seriously though, if the devs are reading this, a Reroll button when selecting your leaders and the option to toggle factions would be an amazing QOL feature!)[/strike] [b]Thank you devs![/b]


I do have a new complaint, though only with the Daily Voyage - They are very creative fun challenges in concept, but I have never gotten past even the first 2 battles, with only a handful of attempts getting to the second battle! The difficulty is almost always at least double that of the normal game, and sometimes you feel forced into either sacrificing a companion early in the battle, risking the rest of the fight, or making a coin flip that will give either long-term safety or immediate defeat (Often due to modifier bells like 'All items are aimless' not giving any guarantees that you can prevent a strong enemy from hitting your leader).

The problem is, there is an achievement for completing a Daily Voyage that unlocks one of the better charms  in the game ([spoiler]Raspberry Charm - +1 Attack +3 Health[/spoiler]) - and most of the time it seems to end up being completely up to chance if you can get past the first stage!

I get there's a leaderboard and allowing retries would let people practice or cheat to get a high score - but why not just make the leaderboard only allow first-attempt scores, but let later attempts unlock the achievement? Some of the challenges can be really interesting or fun - but if you lose because your aimless Junjun decided to hit the wrong enemy, or maybe deploy in the wrong spot: tough luck, try again tomorrow.

Anyway, that is just the Daily Voyage - the game overall is still really fun and it'll stay in my pool of games I go back to when I've got nothing else I feel like doing. The developers are doing a great job and are obviously paying attention to the community -","0","1681756844","true","1052","5918","0","3","0","0","0","0"

Changed to positive Review
Although i still think the price is a bit too high it got some meaningful updates which makes this game overall unique with a fixed spot among all the other roguelike cardbattlers and is just like nothing else - its hard (until you know how to abuse good combos) and sometimes still unfair (due to randomness) but overall still fun to play and .. i just love its own unique charm!
Hopefully they will add at least one addon with a new faction - i think the game would really benefit from more variety and everyone would be happy to pay a reasonable price for that! (something like 4,99 for 1 Faction + new enemy and boss theme + 2 new pets and new Charms for example).
Recommended on sale!

Old Review on launch:

They charge top dollar for this game compared to others in the genre and fail to deliver a balanced fully functioning experience here with some minor bugs and missing QoL on top.

Some say the game is hard but never unfair - i disagree!
Its not as bad as Monster Train (horrible game balance) but it is definately unfair 50% of the time when it comes to miniboss- and boss-fights. 

You choose your team and strategie from what you get offered during the run (RNG alot) and then have to face a miniboss that you could not prepare for because its not shown which boss you will face - often resulting in even dying at the first miniboss encounter - its laughable.

Sometimes you get 2 routes with the same encounters offered - why even bothering giving me a choice? XD (needs fixing!)

And then there is the missing Quality of Life and lack in explaination in general.
No preview of damage done etc., when you add another debuff to a unit that debuffs all enemies you would expect it will add that also to all enemies - until you realise its only applied on the first enemy in its lane - yikes.

Feels like an early access game and i get more and more disappointed with it when thinking about how much money i spent on THAT.
Still - its right now the only game that scratches the monster train itch to some degree with its own charme and unique things ... its not all bad here but devs you better go fix that game!

If i had to rate the game, with 1 being very easy and 10 being maximum difficulty, the game starts off on what feels like an 7 or 8. The game has harder difficulties that unlock once you beat the game the first time, but the starting difficulty curve is already so skewed that the extra difficulty modifiers don't add too much heat to the game. By the time you finally beat the game the first time you would be experienced enough with the game that you don't really feel the difficulty spike (although this most recent update has definitely given the modifiers teeth which might be their solution for this). For players experienced in Card Roguelike game this game will definitely keep you on your toes, but anything less than that and this game entry difficulty level will immediately blindside you and for many render this game unbeatable. If you are looking for a challenging, unforgiving card Roguelike then this game fills that niche, but if you are new to the genre or a casual player then I would not recommend this game. 

Granted, this game just had an update (Update 1.0.6) so they are working and tuning the game, so perhaps a future patch or update could invalidate this review. However, until they finish tuning the starting difficulty level I would hold off on trying this game if this is your first introduction to the genre.","0.501564979553222656","1693447924","false","1783","1783","0","2","0","2","0","0"

The art is fantastic and cute as hell!

Sadly though the difficulty make it so that rather than enjoying the best parts of this game you spend most of your time spamming meta runs until you get the correct RNG.

I have seen some people say that the game isn't that difficult or not that RNG based but to that I ask, what part of the game isn't RNG based?
What combats, which type of combat, bosses, what type of boss, the boss rewards, what events, where the ITEMS THAT ARE NEEDED TO GET THE TRUE ENDING (these items take up an event slot so you get less events on top of being forced down one path, also the items are useless until they combine into a slightly less useless item) are on the map that you can only see a tiny bit of so you cant plan your deck and what cards spawn in every event are all RNG.

The ending is quite lacklustre for how much time it takes to get it.

If you have around 100 hours to chuck off a cliff then I would recommend playing this game but if not just go play slay the spire or peglin.","0.590196192264556885","1693441443","false","6199","6435","0","2","0","14","0","1"

Yes, it is quite difficult, not sure if more than StS, but you have to be on your toes more, more careful all the time.
That's where the difficulty comes from. Even while you have a great build going you have to be thinking pretty much constantly. For an idea of what I'm talking about it's like playing the Time Eater in Slay the Spire... but all the time.

Also while I'm not done with it (only just won a run for the first time after about 25-30 runs) I hope for updates with more mechanics and synergies in the future. It's not that wide yet.

But a wonderful game.

EDIT: version 1.0.6, out today, makes it even better, more fun, more varied. Slightly easier (it was necessary!).
After playing about 36 hours I agree with some other reviewers though: an indicator of 'this character will die this turn' would help a lot. 95% of the times I die it's because I forgot some small piece of information.
An indicator that one of my characters will die if I roll the turn will go a long way. It could even be turned off, for the purists.","0.519654333591461182","1692892480","true","1135","2438","0","5","0","3","0","0"

Under the incredible art and snappy animations, this game was tagged 'difficult' for a reason. Wildfrost does not go easy on you. Most people I've seen giving this game a bad review for 'difficulty' have less than 5 hours of game play. This game can be extremely unforgiving to mistakes in a run, especially at the endgame, so you have to understand you will lose a lot of runs before getting the hang of it. After 80 hours of playing this on and off, I can only appreciate the thought and balancing this team has put into Wildfrost and it's been a joy learning the powerful synergies, hidden under the learning curve. On top of this, I feel there are still many combos I haven't assembled yet. The most recent beta update does make this game a bit nicer, offering the player even more choices than before on reward screens and events. Although the game was certainly winnable before this update, it has opened up the possibility for a 'nut run' every so often.

Usually I love these kinds of deckbuilder rogue-likes. And Wildfrost is, objectively, a really good one, it's polished, sounds great, looks great, and has a lot of interesting ideas and concepts.

But - I just didn't enjoy my time with it very much, and I am not quite sure why that is (Certainly not the difficulty or the randomness...)

I think I have a problem with the cooldown-mechanic, which is at the heart of Wildfrost's identity as a game. To me, it feels a bit clunky and quite punishing at times. It just makes a huge difference whether your turn offers freedom within the confines of a certain amount of mana (as in Slay the Spire or Monster Train), or whether each turn is you sitting there and pondering 2-3 minutes about what card to play. I am oversimplifying a bit here, but for me it regularly breaks the flow of the game and pressures me into playing each individual card for its maximum value, instead of giving meleeway and openness each turn.

Now, I guess this is also where a lot of enjoyment could come from. After all, many people have described Wildfrost more as a puzzle game than a deckbuilder, and I can see the similiarities.

So, maybe decide for yourself. Watch Voyix's streams. He loves it. Perhaps you will too.","0.616613030433654785","1693129066","false","802","802","0","10","0","40","5","0"

I couldn't tell you  what exactly it was that changed, but the game felt a lot more 'fair' and intuitive after updates. Companions felt more able to deal with problems and I was able to beat the game and defeat the final darkness!

It has a bit of the same issue as Slay the Spire in that the game is about 70% 'The hunt for Bullshit' rather than consistent strategy, but it adds to the charm of the genre. The main issue with that is that I've gotten pretty good at the strategy parts to the point that luck is increasingly frustrating when it doesn't go my way.

Honestly, this change is where I personally drew the line. The infinites weren't hard or easy to achieve. It was pretty fair, balanced, and harder to achieve than most games like this. They have consistently taken anything that made the game fun and nerfed it into the fucking ground. Not only am I unable to recommend this game in it's current state, but I don't see myself being able to recommend it in the future either as the devs have their heads way to far up their asses and have repeatedly shown that they don't want you to enjoy their game.

I strongly suggest straying from any game made by this dev team. I waited a couple months to place my review since I always want to give devs a chance to rectify bad changes in their updates.

What's good?

-It's extremely satisfying to play. It puts other deckbuilders to shame in terms of polish. Don't be fooled by the simple graphics, this game slaps, and the presentation is top-notch.
-It's quite challenging until you get the hang of it. This isn't one of those deckbuilders where you 'accidentally' beat it on your first or second try.
-The mechanics are simple, but very effective and interesting. The way the developers approached card upgrades and mechanics is the best I've seen so far.

What's maybe not so good?
-The game is still new and could use some more content. Right now there are very few 'ascension' difficulties to play on
-There are a lot of builds, but not as much as STS and Monster Train for example.

However, more times than not, you can learn and flip the systems for broken builds or clawing back victory from near defeat. (I have experienced some known bugged interactions that are being fixed in the beta...)

The art and sound effects are incredible. The card variety is quite good. The difficulty feels right to me. Most importantly, there aren't any degenerate strategies - every deck you can build has a counter, and every enemy you run into can be countered in multiple ways.

The main two things to remember when you play this game are (1) damage isn't everything, you need to find a way to slow down or divert enemy attacks and (2) you have a lot of tools at your disposal. Companions can be added/removed from your lineup before every fight (meaning you can 'deck build' for every fight!), you can recall allies to heal them, you can shuffle your entire army around between every turn (frequently crucial), and you can swap around crowns (free card plays when the battle starts.

It's become part of my morning routine since it wakes my brain up.  I bought it because I like Chucklefish (the publisher) and I thought it was going to be one of those games I forgot to play for a year.  A friend of mine was excited about the release so I gave it a try and have been playing every day since its release.

It's not an easy game, but I don't really understand why so many people find it frustrating.  If you play it once a day for a couple of weeks you should get the hang of it and at least win on the easy mode.  Once you get to know the deck, charms, etc., you'll see how they can all work together and have fun trying new strategies.  You can learn a lot from playing the dailies, too.  This was my first deck builder game ever and I had no problem learning it.  I'm also still finding new techniques I hadn't thought of so it never gets old.  Also, once you're good at it, you can get through a successful run (with all the challenge bells enabled) in about 30 minutes pretty easily.

Personally, I haven't gotten bored with it yet.  The art is wonderful, I love the music (except for the music that plays when you win), and it's really fun.  Obviously not everyone agrees but I wonder if some of the people who gave up would've found they like the game a lot more if they stopped worrying about how much they were losing for a week or two and just considered it practice.  If you're not constantly trying to think of a winning strategy—which will never apply to every run anyway—then you'll remain open to trying new things and will start doing some powerful things in the game without realizing it.  Enjoy the atmosphere and give it time.  I lost a lot when I started (with no challenge bells) and I almost never lose now (with all challenge bells).

I always try to play a game as it seems the creators intended it to be played because a lot of love goes into these projects (or how else would you be able to commit to finishing an entire game).  From what I can tell, I think the game's primary goal was to make it fun to build upon a large variety of mechanics more than to win.  If you're struggling, try playing with only that in mind.

You always know what's about to happen, so your skill is dependent on your ability to think several turns ahead. 

Due to small deck sizes and the redraw bell, as well as a few other clever ideas, the game almost completely avoids the rng typically associated with difficult deckbuilders. As of playtime, I can only think of a 2-3 moments where randomness significantly impacted my run. 

A huge variety of play patterns and deck types, fresh mechanics, awesome art and a fantastic run loop make this my favorite deckbuilder since Slay the Spire.","0","1692373931","true","2298","2298","0","11","0","0","0","0"

I don't usually write review, but I feel compelled to write this one because this should by any metric be one of my favorite games. I have thousands of hours in Slay the Spire and Monster Train and countless other roguelikes (and a fair number of hours in Rogue itself).

The longer you play this game, the worse it will seem. The number of actual battles is few, and your deck is tested early. This gives you--the player who is supposed  be having fun and making decisions--very little control over what happens. Imagine Slay the Spire with all the small fights that help you build your deck and tailor any given experience taken out. You move rapidly from elite to elite, and if RNGesus isn't on your side, then you're screwed. Many starting leaders have odds of resulting in a  loss so high that the run isn't worth playing, and yet there's no way to reroll them. The rng on charms is so wildly varied that a single bad pull tanks a run. Even just a bad path can kill a whole run.

This game isn't challenging, it's arbitrary. Even after you get good and start winning occasional runs, It won' feel any better. You'll just wonder where your time went and why you didn't play something where your strategy actually mattered. The game's brevity and extreme randomness robs the player of satisfaction in thoughtful strategy and thoughtless fun in equal measure.

Changing the leaders to set, GOOD values like Monster Train could fix all this, but it won't happen so just skip this and play something else. There are too many roguelikes to waste time on one that is trying to pretend like you matter.","0.499423801898956299","1692367416","false","1339","1867","0","6","0","5","1","0"

Losing units in other deckbuilders feels bad enough, in this one it means they will enter the next battle with less health and doing less damage.... sure you can make them retreat to heal (or well some units, some of them have a keyword preventing them from retreating)  but then they won't attack and they will most likely leave your leader wide open to an attack. Being able to play only 1 card per turn is also an interesting but frustrating design decisions... there are ways to mitigate this, but most of those you come by only later in a run, if you can even make it past the first boss. I recognise that people who like harder games will probably enjoy this, but the bottom line for me is that after 10 hours of playtime and winning only 1 run, I'm not really having any fun, the art style is beautiful but that is not enough for me to want to come back and have the game destroy any semblance of a combo I was trying to build yet again","0.473490029573440552","1692282020","false","722","722","0","109","0","4","1","0"

I put in so many hours and tried several different builds, but it just feels like you'd need some crazy combo synergy to even stand a chance. I won't recommend this to sane people who enjoy deck-builders, there are plenty out there that aren't as punishingly difficult.

EDIT: Alright, i think it's fair to update my review after having played it for over 21 hours. My thoughts still haven't changed, this game is still VERY difficult for the average person who enjoyed deckbuilding roguelites. The floor difficulty should be toned down a bit in order to give players a chance to experience the game, and then they can push the difficulty up if they so choose to. At the time of writing, i've lost 51 times until i finally built a deck and had enough game knowledge in order to win. Some people will pick up the game much faster and some won't, but i guarantee there are many like me who will not understand how to actually play and make calculated deck-building choices, which will leave them feeling like the game 'cheated' them out of a win. The game is good overall but until the base difficulty is lowered, I cannot give my reccomendation unless you are willing to put in the time to learn the what works and what doesn't.

EDIT2: Alright, after playing the newest beta, i feel that the balance is finally a bit more in favor of the inexperienced, it's still hard but a few of the card changes and enemy adjustments make the early game a little easier so you can get the ball rolling. I can now fully recommend the game.","0.589732348918914795","1681343282","true","513","4332","0","134","0","0","0","0"

The music and graphics are fantastic. Also some of the interactions like breaking your new characters out of ice really makes the game feel unique in that department.
On the gameplay side I would say it is similar to monster train though also very different at the same time.
The difficulty level might be hard at first but it will definitely get easier over time. I would also say, from personal experience that ascension 20 on slay the spire is definietly harder than the endgame of this game. Which is not bad, in fact I enjoy the difficulty level way more, as it does not feel like one little mistake at the beginning might mean the end of a run. 
Overall I would say this game is on a great track to becoming a very unique and fun experience in the card battler genre.

2. solid replayability due to the different 'clans' i.e. base decks + the daily mode which can be super challenging tho

3. medium-hard to hard difficulty (so if you want a walk in the park kinda game this is not it prolly)

i completed my first 2 tries actually so i dont think that the game is TOO hard as long as you take your time to really think about everything thats going on. i defo sat there for up to 5-10 minutes just to think about the exact order of what i needed to do and how the enemy would react. the abilites and timers are usually well telegraphed and explained (theres some ability interactions of your CUTE cards that you need to try out yourself but i think thats half of the fun - unless you re close to beating the game and it ruins the run maybe...ye life sucks sometimes). if you just go decide your actions halfheartedly you can easily ruin the run so you really got think at least 2 to 3 steps ahead in most cases. some encounters (by that i mean CUTE enemy/ CUTE boss types) are WAY harder than others so there will be difficulty spikes.

PS: snowballs and freeze are broken! so if u want it slightly easier you should stick to that deck (thats prolly also the reason why you start out the game with that deck)

also the cards are CUTE","0.505933821201324463","1691360696","true","675","1172","0","6","0","1","0","1"

First, let's get something obvious out of the way: the art and music are extremely good, there is absolutely no doubt about that.
Let's talk about the gameplay a bit. I am a big fan of it, Managing your board feels great and is extremely interesting when you try to make the most out of the game's mechanics, such as combo kills. It clicks with me in all the good ways, and if you're a fan of deck building roguelites (even though it's quite different from the usual deck building experience) then you'll probably like it too. But that's not what's memorable about this game for me. Rather, the most interesting part of this game to me is how it handles difficulty.

I would say that the difficulty of the game is probably on the harder side, but calling it 'way too hard' would be doing the experience a disservice. Rather, the game will punish your lack of attention to some enemies, and considering that mistakes can cost you a run pretty much instantly, this is as memorable as a sting, especially if your run was going great. However, I find that this game's difficulty actually is interesting in that it forces you to think outside of the box a lot when you activate the harder difficulty levels. When you do so, you really have to utilize the mechanics that are at your disposition to stand a chance. This game can be quite challenging and I would dare say 'annoying' when it comes to spawning certain enemies that happen to directly counter what you have going (I am looking at you, teeth charm) but when you get past the annoyance you find out the game has pretty sick ways of finishing some fights and that for me is the greatest thing about it. You do get a lot of eureka moments when certain things do click in your head in terms of the options at your disposal and that is probably the best feeling this kind of game can ever give to you. 

If this is the kind of feeling you are longing for, and do not mind the absolutely brutal difficulty at times, then this game is for you, and you'll probably spend as much time inside it as I have.","0.710061252117156982","1691097190","true","5904","7585","0","4","83","28","0","0"

The Good:

Harder to turn your deck into some god unstoppable deck
Having up to 6 units creates more interesting game play than games like Slay the Spire IMO
No Stupid town shop that just makes you objectively more powerful each run.

Games needs more difficulties, both the easiest difficulty is probably too hard for some and the hardest difficulty is too easy for skilled players.

Tired of Slay the Spire clones and same-same card game mechanic? try the game it's worth it.

[hr][/hr] 
I read one Review which stated that the game has a very unique Cardgame mechanic compared with many other titles released in the past years. I guess that intrigued me the most and after a few hours of playing I can totally agree with that statement.

The baseline for any Rouge-like / lite cardgame genre would be Slay the Spire imho. 

In my experience games with the same core concepts would be (to name a few)
[list]
[*]Roguebook
[*]Gordian Quest
[*]Pirates Outlaws
[*]Mahokenshi
[*]Banners of Ruin
[/list]

Samey concepts:
[list]
[*]shiddy starter cards
[*]AP based Turn / Play as long as you can in your turn
[*]Global Relics / Artefact modifiers 
[*]Some sort of Row / Lane mechanic
[/list]

Of course all those game imlemented some sort of innovation. Multiple characters, multiple lanes, a story, interessting art styles.. they are all good games but in a way they all feel the same.

I guess Wildfrost innovated the card battler with:
[list]
[*]Charms / Modifiers which can be added to cards (Banner of Ruins did a similar thing)
[*]Moving units during your turn is free
[*]A Turn ends after playing any none-turn-ending card or when redrawing cards before redraw timer reaches zero
[*]each unit on the field has a round counter after which round it will attack. The counter can be modified for your own aswell as enemy units
[*]you lose when your leader is killed
[*]both Units and direct effect spells are concidered cards. Most charms and their respective effect can be applied to either a direct card effect or a unit. For example a snow / freeze additional status effect would cause a units attack to deal snow status effect, but the Charm could also be applied to a direct effect card.
[*]seems like there are not many restrictions how you play card. A direct damage card can also be played on your units
[/list]

Other noteworthy games to check out in terms of different card game mechanic:
[list]
[*]Trials of Fire
[*]Tainted Grail
[*]Ratropolis
[*]Hellcard
[/list]

It's very challenging and brutal to get the hang of the game, but once you understand the mechanics properly, you can make it quite deep.

Anyone that complains it's too hard, hasnt played the game long enough to unlock additional charms and cards to improve the game journey.

I read a few reviews that will end up echoing my opinion, however I decided to give the game a shot to see for myself as I was thirsty for some deck-building rogue-like fun.

At the core Wildfrost has all the mechanics to make for a successful rogue-like deck-builder, borrowing some of the lane combat that you might find similar to monster train, except there are 2 always active lanes rather than 3 cascading lanes.  There are enhancements for cards (charms), units that you can deploy, and a host of other tools to improve your deck.  Also similar to monster lane, you get a randomly generated hero to choose from, however if they die at any time you lose the game.  Their health is thankfully restored between rounds.

My gripe with this game is the difficulty.  In five hours I was never able to complete one run while having a good grasp of the mechanics AND trying multiple different play-styles.  This game just is not very obvious in how rounds will play out with there being too much to carry out.  Although complexity in a deck builder yields better long term health for the game, I just found it to be off putting especially when being open to trying different strategies in the game.  I would sometimes have what I thought was the perfect run but there is ultimately going to be one set of enemies that hard counter your build and throw you out of the game.  The fact that leader death means losing the game fully makes these encounters extremely punishing and impossible to navigate without a particular play-style that I just wasn't able to figure out.

The meta progression doesn't really help you ramp up your chances of success, with unlocks being tied behind achievements that are sometimes quite particular or require multiple runs to achieve slowly down your progress and forcing you to continue to grind for items that may or may not improve your experience.

Overall this game is difficult, and I recognise that may appeal to some.  So I encourage you to play it and try it for yourself, but this game just was not for me.","0.517852127552032471","1690747011","false","286","286","0","12","716","12","4","0"

Going in, was concerned by the reviews complaining about RNG. Yes, there is some randomness to which cards you might have available or which ones you will go up against. But that's what keeps things interesting in a roguelike and it forces you to adapt. If you mindlessly push one strategy every game, regardless of whether it will be effective, you will lose.

Read the rest of the review but after playing dozens more hours because i wanted to finish the final boss...
I basically cheesed the game kind of luck and rng allowed me to create this team where i could CC everyone with snow + a character that gained permanent upgrade to offence of every instance of snow, deadly.
I destroyed the boss, perfectly clear that its mostly luck and what happens? your team that you created becomes the next final boss.... game uninstalled

WildFrost Review - A Frosty Mix of Fun and Frustration

Introduction:
WildFrost is a quirky card game and rogue-lite that embraces delightful cartoon graphics and upbeat music, drawing players in with its whimsical charm. Inspired by the acclaimed 'Slay the Spire,' WildFrost introduces exciting twists to the genre, promising an engaging and strategic gameplay experience. However, beneath its endearing facade lies a frustrating reliance on RNG (Random Number Generation) that can leave players feeling powerless and defeated, ultimately hindering the full potential of the game.

Graphics and Sound:
One of WildFrost's strongest points is undoubtedly its visually appealing cartoon graphics. The vibrant and charming art style complements the game's theme, making each encounter a joy to behold. The fun music adds to the lighthearted atmosphere, enhancing the overall gaming experience.

Gameplay and Twists:
The incorporation of rogue-lite elements adds a layer of replayability and unpredictability to WildFrost, keeping players engaged and curious about what each run will bring. The concept of starting with a leader of a tribe, each with randomized stats and perks, is intriguing and adds variety to subsequent playthroughs.

Moreover, the idea of tribes offering unique starter decks is a refreshing twist, encouraging players to explore different strategies and playstyles. This diversity initially sparks excitement and curiosity, but the novelty can wear thin when the core issue surfaces.

The RNG Dilemma:
While randomness is a central element in rogue-lite games, WildFrost may have leaned too heavily into the hands of fate. The game's high dependence on RNG in determining the leader's stats and perks at the start of each run often leads to a frustrating experience. Even with well-thought-out decisions and skilled gameplay, players might find themselves at the mercy of luck, leading to unavoidable defeats.

This level of unpredictability can diminish the sense of achievement that comes from mastering card synergies and strategic thinking, as players may perceive that their efforts are futile when luck doesn't favor them. The lack of control over the initial setup can be a significant drawback, dampening the overall enjoyment.

Conclusion:
WildFrost presents an alluring world with its charming visuals, delightful music, and a promising twist on the card game and rogue-lite genre. However, its over-reliance on RNG, particularly in the randomized leader stats and perks, hinders the potential for skill-based gameplay. The frustration that arises from unavoidable losses due to poor RNG can leave players feeling disillusioned and less inclined to keep playing.

While the game's concept and art style hold tremendous potential, improvements to reduce the impact of RNG and enhance player agency would significantly benefit WildFrost. Until then, the frustrating elements overshadow the enjoyable aspects, making it difficult to wholeheartedly recommend the game in its current state.","0.487113416194915771","1690132042","false","1277","2968","0","3","526","1","1","0"

First off, the art is at least 13/10, if not higher, like I keep wanting to unlock more things just to see what they look like (and in particular I keep using Noomlin charms every time I find one even if that'd be inadvisable just because they're so adorable).

As for the gameplay, it has a bit of a learning curve at the start even with how it gives you things piecemeal and keeps them relatively simple to begin, and the action economy of shuffling a companion back into the deck to heal them versus leaving them out to potentially take a lethal blow for you and get off another attack is nontrivial to plot out. I also had a spot of trouble in that I somehow missed that you could stick up to *three* charms per card and kept going with one per, assuming trying to drop another on would swap them. I had a *much* easier time after I figured out they stack.

That being said I'm still annoyed that (first run completion spoilers) [spoiler] I went through all the trouble of setting up a mutual kill on the frost guardian and the frost spirit didn't even have the decency to revert to its original body, it's still the character I lost the first time I beat it even though the spirit *should've* been left without a target to take over, and I'm annoyed I apparently lost a run to that even though that should've been the best case scenario of killing the prior guardian and not letting it take a stronger host. [/spoiler] 

But that's a personal gripe, and it doesn't actually detract from the game. Overall highly recommended.","0","1690255117","true","824","2059","0","1","0","0","0","1"

This is my 2nd review of this game, the first was negative, but I decided to change it entirely since the devs listened to the community and fixed the aweful balance of the game. There is still work to do, but not as much as before. To those being scared by people complaining about difficulty (they are right to do so), please don't be. The next patch will make the game much easier, trust me I've been playing it a lot in beta :)

[b]The Right[/b]
+ Appealing graphics and music
+ Some original takes on the genre -> stacking bom to increase dmg inflicted, spawning adds then sacrificing them for bonuses, etc.
+ Plenty of content for the price

[b] Negative [/b]
- Bad Charms balancing -> some of them are still uber useless*
- Could enjoy more achievements (they unlock Charms ! Well, they also unlock shitty Charms :/)

Now you can select one of three leaders for each clan, giving you a total of 9 options per run. While they haven't added an 'End Turn' button, they did update the UI to show a cards effects for the upcoming turn.  The new crown reward mechanic also means that you don't need to buy a crown at every shop or be crippled in your run.  Overall I can switch my review to recommend.  I'll leave my review of the game at launch below.

The game is almost aggressively middle of the road.  The art style is cute and fun, but the battle music is repetitive and distracting.  The 3 clans each have some unique game play, but the randomly generated leaders mean that sometimes you can't play your favorite deck because the leader is hot garbage this time around.  The game would greatly benefit from an 'End Turn' button, trying to parse all of the effects on a crowded board is hard enough without having to also account for the changes your new card will create.","0.474999994039535522","1681698056","true","597","18652","676","3","0","0","0","0"

Played it for 10 hours and never beat it before giving up. I enjoyed those 10 hours, and the art and music is absolutely fantastic, and it plays great on the deck.

What killed it for me in the end is that I simply don't see a way to win. While I enjoyed the 10 hours, the difficulty ramp can be brutal, and the progression mechanics aren't helping.

If I have a singular gripe with the game, it's that something like 80% of my losses are not because I got outplayed, boxed into a corner, etc, but because I missed a detail of who was attacking who, when they were attacking, or what the chain effects of some things would be. The end result is those don't feel like legit losses, but like I simply missed a detail and lost the entire run. That isn't learning, that's punishment. The game would benefit greatly from some increased player information similar to Slay the Spire, where it calls out things like 'This character will die this turn!' or gives some previews of information.

I don't typically take the time to review a game. I think this is one of those very rare occasions when I should.

I got this game because I love deck builder games. Slay the Spire MTG you know what I mean. This game starts out so easy to learn, so fun and wholesome. The music and graphics are fun and upbeat. I even had an absolute blast playing it while I did. 

16 play hours later and over 70 straight losses and I cannot help but wonder if there is a code to counter your deck in particular instances to increase the length of the game and if that bugged out on some of us because there cannot possibly be a perfect counter every single run.

Others have mentioned it, you build a deck type and you WILL face the direct counter to it. Now you may think, 'I can just overcome the counter, right?' Your hope of beating the decks that have literally been designed to destroy you is 0. My best attempt against a hard counter got me a through a wave and a half. Not even close. This has happened over 70 times. 

You might think I just have trouble with hard games. Well for reference I loved and fully beat Bloodborne, Darkest Dungeon, Demon Souls, Enter the Gungeon among others. Those are punishing games and I adored them. 

This game is just ridiculous.","0.517784655094146729","1681416853","true","973","3948","0","9","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is original and interesting, and, unlike most negative reviews suggest, the game balance is actually on point as long as you keep your full attention on the board. The catch is that the moment you make a careless move you die. One thing on the board can trigger many other things on the board, and event chains that are triggered by your play can be long, entangled, and confusing. There are no move previews and no takebacks, you either keep your full attention on the game for an hour, or you lose. Some simple tool like rewinding the fatal card play would do strides, but it just isn't in the game.

From what I see in the discussions, more hardcore gamers find Wildfrost fun to toy around at first, but the game becomes too shallow to entertain them quickly and they abandon it after a dozen hours or so. This impression is supported by that every single roguelike/deckbuilder/CCG streamer abandoned Wildfrost after a week at longest.

It a pity, really. The game is charming and I love the art, the sound, the story, and the gameplay. It's just that I cannot relax for a moment while playing it which kills it for me.","0.578118562698364258","1689796638","false","2168","2971","0","13","0","16","1","0"

Pros:
-Incredible artstyle and soundtrack.
-Really good gameplay. It's not just a deckbuilding game, positioning your units adds another whole dimension to the game that makes every combat more challenging and unique.
-The variety of cards and charms for a beta is really really good which makes it very replayable.

Cons:
-Althouhgt the variety of cards and charms is there I feel like the amount and variety of enemy combats is not there. You always fight the same 1-2 hordes of enemies on every combat spot and since there are only a few and long ones they can end up feeling repetitive.

Overall I feel like this game has HUGE potential and is a must pick up if you are a fan of the roguelike deckbuilding genre. Haven't had this must fun in a card game since slay the spire and I feel like this game has the edge in several aspects over it.

If you like Slay the Spire and are disappointed by balance issues and lack of depth in other deckbuilders, this game will disappoint too.

I do not share other reviewers opinion of the game being too luck-based and frustrating. In contrary, I found the game too easily solvable. Frost is strong. Multi-hit is strong. Offense solves defense, but not vice-versa. After a few runs, it was mostly clear from looking at the cards what is strong and what isn't; what works and what doesn't. In fact, I am puzzled how some mechanics made it into the game. 'Sacrifice' strategies for example are severely crippled by board space. Furthermore Companions that do nothing unless sacrificed make absolutely no sense if they end up Injured after the fight. As often in these cases, enemies are weak enough so that these low-performing strategies can succeed, leading to a situation where the game is either trivially easy with a good deck, or challenging but really awkward with a bad one.
Having such a high variance in the power level of the normal ending boss inevitably leads to many runs where the final encounter is an absolute pushover. This completely nullifies the sense of relief and accomplishment at the end of a successful run which is normally a major strong point the genre.

Unsuccessful runs are mostly lost in a sudden and anticlimactic fashion, by having your leader die due to either negligence, or an unexpected chain of mechanics triggering. 

Some cards and charms are almost game winning on their own, while others are borderline useless. The crown from the shop is so powerful that buying it is correct in 95% of cases. Taking the path with a shop on the last map is correct in 95% of cases. If playing to win, most choices in this game are too trivial to really require one to think.

I've seen >80% of the games content within 2 hours of playing. Meta Progression is too slow and the gimmicky nature of unlock requirements encourages you to do things during runs that are detrimental to you winning. I have finished the game with every tribe at least twice and got the 3 win streak achievement, yet I have less than half of the unlocks. I have unsuccessfully tried to get to the true ending multiple times, as it is seemingly locked behind certain items that you are not guaranteed to find in your run. Having seen most of what the game has to offer many times over, I have little motivation to keep playing.

It's a decent game to play causally and the first few hours were genuinely fun. It looks great and is fun to learn. If you are a more casual player, you might not be as irritated as I was by the games balance and gamedesign issues. I would normally write this off as me simply not being the target audience of the game, however the 'difficult' tag the developers put on it justifies, in my opinion, my criticism.

All this being said, this game does not feel like a 20$ game.","0.475314319133758545","1685433668","false","665","775","0","2","197","1","1","0"

This game is fantastic but it'll break your mental to your core. Its polished, cute, and quirky visuals hide its deep-seated complexity, but updates are doing a better and better job of explaining mechanics as you encounter them and balancing some mechanics (srsly the fact you can now move crowns around is clutch). But one mistake, [b]one[/b] misread [b]one[/b] [i]slight[/i] misinterpretation of a mechanic can end a run in one turn since your character is always on the board and typically does not have a ton of health. Yet it doesn't feel like playing by the rules forces you to play the game in an unnatural way. The way all the mechanics harmonize with each other is so slick that it's mind-boggling to me that they nailed it this well. I'd say this is a very refreshing take on the maturing roguelike deckbuilder genre that deserves your attention if especially if you're a fan of the genre. 
a quick nitpick though (minor spoiler of a major game mechanic):
I still think charms as they are implemented are very RNG-based, and I'm pretty discouraged about rolling for charms now as a lot of charms don't seem versatile. (builds typically only benefit from a handful of charms at a time which means you can keep rolling for charms and keep spending resources getting the wrong ones). When you get a couple good ones, it can do lots towards your run, but when you don't it can completely stall it.","0","1689648963","true","1408","2011","0","8","0","0","0","0"

For a solid month, I kept coming back to Wildfrost over, and over again. Each time you win a run, the deck you win with becomes the new final boss. Trying to figure out how to counter my own busted strategy had me thinking about Wildfrost well after each play session. It's a small thing, but that meta-level interaction within the game adds something to the game that is completely absent from every other card game I've sunk time into.

It helps that Wildfrost also has a couple of its own ideas that form up a pretty strong identity. You're able to shift which lanes your cards are in each turn, as well as recall them from the field to replay them. It seems like a small addition, but shuffling your cards around to prepare for a future turn, or simply dealing with an immediate threat adds a lot more thought to individual turns. This is especially true in the early game, where a handful of misplays can promptly end your run. I know that might feel discouraging for some, but I found it wholly refreshing given how boring the early game of other games tends to be once you develop familiarity with the title.

Don't sleep on Wildfrost. I promise it's worth it.

Update: After many more runs and hours poured into this game my opinion stands - despite some adjustments. You find yourself in too many unwinnable positions not entirely your fault. This is due mostly because of the complexity of the mechanics not clearly conveying what the heck is going to happen. Like why can't the game run a quick simulation while I'm planning my turn to tell me which allies or at least my leader are gonna be killed. Put a little skull icon on them to denote this. 

This game is just frustrating to play. You can be on a great run and one mistake like 4 turns ago creates a situation where you're screaming at your monitor because there is nothing you can do against that fucking monkey king.

THIS GAME IS NOT FUN.

Your strategy doesn't matter, it doesn't matter what your build is nor how often you try because the game is consistently stacked against you. This massive IMBALANCE means you will lose a lot and its not fun. Its not fun to put an hour into your build only to have the enemy before an end boss immediately take out 6 new creatures each with 40 health and smack back against an auto attack build. Its not fun that every enemy has more attack and health than you. Its not fun that the scaling doesn't take your own build into effect either.

'its a rogue lite bro, its the RNG bro' fuck off. There is a reason Slay the Spire still sits at most card players top list and its because there are learnable mechanics you can plan your team around and find success in how you play your cards not what your up against. 

If you want this bullshit to work but also want to add the ability to allow players to feel comfort against the 'RNG', just add one system - upgrades. Allow players to increase the health and attack of cards, augment their champion so they actually feel like the centre of the build and add effects like frenzy to favourite cards.
Take out the grind by letting people win.

On the positive side of things, The deck building aspect is great.  The tactical lane battling is great.  Tons of different builds to play with.  The random Leaders keep runs fresh.  The daily keeps me coming back every day!   Also, the Devs seem to be engaged because they've already put an update out that fixed many issues  with the game and balanced a bunch of companions.

On the negative side of things, which is very short, more content and the game is brutally hard and unforgiving if you miss one little thing.  You miss a certain charm, teeth, attack order, how much frenzy they have, do they have strike back or a myriad of other effects that can kill a run so easily.

EDIT: Even though I still love this game, something needs to be done to fix situations where an accident occurs and you need to rewind.  I was literally just playing the daily run and accidentally snowed my front guy instead of the enemies front guy and it cost me the run.  THAT SHOULD NOT HAPPEN.  This game is difficult enough that an error like that should be able to be fixed/rewound or something.  VERY ANNOYING!

The reviews about the difficulty curve, especially at launch, were somewhat accurate but overstated. Especially as they continue to patch it, and as I continue to learn it, the game feels great. Comments about the game being wildly unbalanced have mismanaged their expectations due to the charming art style.

This game is hard and demands focus. It's quite punishing for mistakes. When you learn the game well, and unlock some of the metaprogression, though, it starts to all feel fairly well-tuned.

Additionally, this game has undoubtedly one of the if not the most polished UX/UI experiences I have ever seen. The detail and care put into every single interactable thing vastly exceeds expectations. The art and sound are consistent, well-drawn, and deeply add to the experience.

Devs seem committed to tuning and supporting the game, and the upcoming 1.06 seems to promise even more quality-of-life and overall improvements.

Overall, I'd recommend it. Not as casual as it might look, but has some very interesting systems. Not as replayable as Slay the Spire, but certainly within striking distance.

If you are put off by the negative reviews, allow me to try and persuade you otherwise.
But first, yes, the game is hard. 
Not in an infuriating way. If you like a good challenge, then this game is for you.

Runs are quite short which reduces the frustration of failing and, like any good roguelite, you are unlocking new things each time you play.
The artwork is beautiful and, honestly, I think it also plays a part in making the replay-ability that much more enjoyable.
While there's not much choice in the way of branching paths (compared with other roguelites), your choices definitely make a big impact. 
Charms can be incredibly powerful, but it's often more important to make sure you have enough companions first - and money for when you find a shop.
If you find yourself losing repeatedly, switch things up, take a different path, and try a new tactic.

There's a lot of things packed into this game:
Leader choice (and corresponding card deck), different types of allies (pets, companions, clunkers, summons), an insane amount of buffs/debuffs and unique card effects, a wide range of items, crowns that let you start with guaranteed cards from your deck that you can also place for free, and of course the charms which can be attached to your leader, allies, or even items cards to buff them in different ways.
All of these things interact with each other in interesting ways and open up SO much room for strategy and creativity.

Charms are definitely where the game shines in my opinion.
While they're relatively simple, they offer really satisfying synergies.
Some are just straightforward buffs like +2 damage, or applying a status effect to the enemy.
Adding them onto companions who attack multiple times can increase this bonus considerably.
Many of them can seem lacklustre, but using them on an item instead of a companion can make a huge difference - even just equipping them in the right order can help you get the most out of their effects.

For example, the Pomegranate charm decreases your companion's damage, but allows their attacks to hit every enemy in a row - which can be a very effective trade-off.
On the other hand, the Peppereaper is an item that can temporarily increase one of your companion's damage in exchange for hurting them slightly...
Putting the Pomegranate charm on this item allows you to remove all the negative effects (it now deals 0 damage), while also letting you buff all the allies in that row.
You can even stack multiple charms on a single card and, if you get the chance to duplicate a card, the charms are duplicated as well.

There's a lot going on, a lot of things to pay attention to, and a lot to learn.
I can certainly understand it being overwhelming for the first few runs (or for a few more runs after that), but that satisfying feeling when it all clicks... really makes for an incredibly fun game.
However, make sure you're ready to adapt and learn new strategies - because, once you finally beat the game, that's where the real challenge begins.","0.507299244403839111","1689263965","true","1727","13461","0","4","0","1","0","0"

In other deckbuilders there's always a ramp in difficulty so that you can get used to the mechanics. There is no luxury here. You are tossed directly in and are meant to build a competitive deck within the first 3 battles. The difficulty ramp is way too insane for anyone to learn any mechanics. 

That isn't my biggest gripe in terms of ramp, the fact that you are juggling around a champion who has variable health to units who can deal so much damage is the biggest downside for me. It's not really worth putting that much effort to learn how mechanics work when the roguelike aspects of the game come into play so quickly that it feels oppressive. Having to juggle bosses that can one shot against a deck that can't ramp is not fun. Like there is much deck thinning early to help and when you do get it the bosses/units are already out of control and your deck can't really do much by thinning due to RNG nature of the cards you get.

Until there's a tutorial mode to help newer players into this genre this is going to be a no from me. I enjoy a challenge but this is on the extreme end and would likely deter most people from continuing on.

*Update* After some changes, It's a much better game state than it was before. The changes implemented are showing that the devs are listening to feedback with how new players are onboarded into this genre and making it much easier to know how the mechanics in this game work in depth. The added turn order will show how combat turns work making it easier for newer players to determine best attack order or how to defend. While it won't make the game easier for newer players it will at least provide a much more info to deal with mechanics earlier rather than frustratingly hit their head against the wall each and every time.","0.505743563175201416","1684788326","true","503","578","0","8","0","0","0","0"

With interesting ideas in its gameplay, and a twist for the 'final' boss that is a stroke of genius, the game shows that it isn't merely pretty, it's fun too!

However, it is an exceedingly punitive game, as one mistep will easily cost you your entire run. This issue is greatly compounded by the fact that the ordering of actions isn't always easy to envision, leading to very frustrating deaths. (And, to be fair, also a bit compounded by the fact that the game & music is so cute, which does the opposite of keeping you on your toes!)

It's worth noting that the devs have tried to take steps to address these issues, rather successfully. But a lot of work remains to be done. Expect a steep learning curve, but a thoroughly enjoyable experience afterwards.

The game has definitely been feeling fairer and easier as time went on, leading me to believe that beyond the steep initial curve is a nice walk uphill. So much so that I was even able to complete a 3 win streak after about 12h!

In closing, I want to highlight threeelements for this review:

1- Though the game has a decent chunk of content to explore, it remains on the shallow-y side. Much works remains to be done if the devs want to become a serious competitive to Slay the Spire, and other 'thousand-hours' titles. I'm not sure Wildfrost even has a fifty hours of content at this point. (And if it ever does, we will probably need a way to remove unlockables from the pool)
2- Beyond beginner mistakes made by unforeseen chains of events, there is also a definite mental fatigue that quickly sets-in after only one run. It's not just me, I have been able to see it in streamers as well. So even when the mecanics are understood, calculating turns DOES remain extremely intense mentally. I hope that turn prediction tools & other improvements do account for regular players and not just the new player experience.

Overall I'd say that Wildfrost is definitely a steal even with its current 1.0.5 content. (Don't forget to buy the OST!)
Sure, it's not nearly at its full potential at the moment, but the experience is already well worth the price.

ridiculously hard though, im all for a hard game and pick the hardest difficulty in any game i play, but the first 3 hours or so takes forever with you just running into a wall to unlock enough stuff before you get your first good run. theres a difference between being hard and just not fun at a certain point and this game definitely leans towards the not fun side of things after a few hours. its about memorization which takes a lot of the roguelite elements out cause the first fight and boss are always the exact same patterns

game gets a little easier once you get some of the mechanics down and unlock enough stuff for a good run. 
i wouldnt recommend it personally, like i said the first 3 hours are essentially a training tutorial that you unlock stuff in for the dopamine hits off the digital dragon before you get a good run in.

Third boss means gameover in 90 % of my runs. That's not really far into a run at all.... The rest of the run consists of a megaton of RNG. Choose between crappy buff cards, companions, charms that don't help you at all, etc.

On the bright side the game is quite stylish and flashy and everything you do slightly upgrades the town which adds new feature to future runs. Unfortunately all the town upgrades so far didn't make any difference either...... I actually found the second unlocked tribe highly annoying.

Considering how far I got I didn't really experience all that much content (the same few cards and fights over and over again). My verdict is therefore 'not recommended'. At least not for the full price.","0","1688947026","false","144","193","0","70","0","1","1","0"

The complexity comes from having to constantly manage and move around 2 rows of allies to get the most out of your damage, tanks, and aoe effects. It takes a lot of time to plan each turn because you need to make sure damage dealt and taken will be applied correctly to the correct units. This is not for people that want to blast through the game.


Suggestion:
1. Please add a preview button.


Tips:
1. Always have 80 gold before the shop. Getting crown at each shop and putting them on your units gives incredible turn advantage.
2. Summoned units are broken.
3. Cutting cards is only useful if your deck's power is in your spells.
4. You always need some sort of defense, but snow >>> heal > barrier.
5. Poison is way to slow in this game.

I draft on and off at my LGS and I have a more rewarding experience and it costs me less than the price of this game, buy it if it goes below the price of a pack of cards and enjoy knowing you could likely have a better time printing the cards out and playing it with friends rather than against the random hyper tuned decks this game pits you against.

I am an avid fan of rougelikes and I understand there is supposed to be an element of stacked odds but I honestly can't say I have had more fun playing this game over Hades and or Dead Cells and I've only beaten them a handful of times, hell I have a better time with Darkest Dungeon and I haven't beaten it either but at least it feels like you are supposed to fail, and it gives you a little bit of grace before completely stripping you of all your progress.","0","1682648972","false","733","3089","0","11","0","0","0","0"

At that time, the most common review was 'the game is too poorly balanced; too difficult' and, while I sure do love a challenge, I was hesitant to play a game with poor balancing, a feature I attribute a lot of importance to.
However, after buying the game and getting every achievement except for the final hidden achievement (that is my next goal), I find this 'poorly balanced' game to be absolutely perfect for my standards. The game is certainly ruthless and can get very complex very quickly, but it is just the right amount of challenge to appease me, and frankly, I feel bad for the people who played the game expecting it to be just as pleasant as the fun art style and soundtrack. Every new run I find myself going on, even the ones I feel I have been horribly unlucky since the start, I always find a way to outwit the game and win despite impossible odds, and it requires some excitingly stimulating brainpower to do so. It is just this concept--being able to win no matter what hand you are played (literally)--that leads me to believe that the game isn't poorly balanced, but the opposite. In the end, though, you need to be able to play your hand to beat the odds.
As I'm writing this, the 1.0.6 beta has been available to opt into for about a week, and, following the masses' demands, it naturally includes tons of 'balancing' features (that is to say, features to make the game easier). I refuse to play the beta and plan to stick to the current, 'unbalanced' version for as long as possible, getting every achievement and finishing my 'permanent progression' (another gripe people had, but in truth it's more like a drawn-out tutorial to introduce you to mechanics; the progression reaches a halt quickly) before even considering if I want to test the calm waters of the beta. If you are reading this review now and crave a mentally stimulating challenge that makes you feel confident in your ability to win despite the odds being against you, I recommend you get the game as soon as you can before it is developed into a more boring mildness.","0.523809552192687988","1688779819","true","2233","6678","0","5","0","1","0","0"

I've played enough roguelikes to make peace with some runs just being unwinnable no matter how well you play, but Wildfrost's cards are so weak and enemies so strong that most runs feel unwinnable. The key to victory is finding and building a powerful combo of units, which is an unreasonable request when we have so little control over what cards we encounter in a single run. Even then, it is possible to be overwhelmed by the power and abilities enemies bring to encounters.

Even all of that wouldn't be a deal breaker. What really crushed my interest in the game was winning my first run, using a powerful combination of units, only for the game to take those units, juice their stars, and make them the new final boss.

2 out of 5

This game does not implement a good enough card game, instead, some of its features are just too annoying.

1. You die just because if you don’t see an icon on the cards. I know that calculations are essential, but does it have to be serious enough for me to die  so quick?
2. Your main character must remain on board or you die. Surely I can do something to make it live, but I guess you will be as surprised as I am to see the enemy boss split into two and reborn while your main character has only got 1 pt life left.

I used to play Magic the Gathering and PTCG but none of them are as crazy as this one. Please work hard on balance and hints.","0.474516689777374268","1688668631","false","12","5785","0","12","315","0","1","0"

Paul Zimmerman and Felix Barbarino know how to get a person hyped for an epic showdown where death is on the line!  Absolute banger battle music.

Wildfrost has a fun game play loop, an awesome art style and enough variety as a roguelike to keep you entertained.  People compare this game to Slay the Spire (which is fair) but I think it is closer in style to Nowhere Prophet and Monster Train which focus on building a team and supporting that team with a powerful deck.

People who complain Wildfrost is difficult are 50% to blame because they don't have the patience to do math or read the card effects; that's normally what kills you in this game (I know I did).  The other 50% is actually because the game randomness is pretty challenging at times.  Also I'll admit the 'Teeth' enemies are incredibly tough to deal with.

As of writing this review the game is in a difficulty dichotomy: v1.05 is challenging and v1.06 beta is super easy.

When I played v1.05 the game requires very good planning and play to get to the end boss (not the true end boss).  Died multiple times at the beginning and halfway points due to bad rolls and bad play.  I was able to beat the end boss twice but only at the first bell modifier.

When I downloaded the v1.06 beta and played with those changes I was able to steam roll through all the encounters to the end boss multiple times. The main changes are the extra modifier bell choices, more money per fight and the ability to pick a race and then pick between 3 random heros of that race (which is one of the best changes imo to give you a fighting chance, very good change the devs made.) 

The game was too easy due to the amount of money and crowns I was able to pick up which allowed me to set up plays that crushed boss fights in 4 turns or less.  I eventually beat the true end boss on my 4th attempt.  I know the devs are trying to make the game more palatable for new players but it's way too easy in my opinion.

Wildfrost would benefit greatly from 2 things: more variety and finding a nice middle ground between the differences in v1.05 and v1.06.  Crowns are OP and money flows in v1.06 imo.

By more variety, I mean more enemies, more pathway splits to choose from, more random events and more bosses; see StS and NP for examples.  The item variety and current selection of characters is perfectly viable right now and doesn't need changes.  

Overall a great game and worth the money.  If the devs ever release an expansion pack or a Wildfrost 2 I would buy from them.","0.523809552192687988","1688599212","true","2919","7652","0","12","150","1","0","0"

The basic comparison is to Slay The Spire, but with a ton more strategy in combat and strategic decisions out of combat. It's also a lot harder, to the point where people complain about difficulty or balance issues. I don't think it was that bad but there has already been a balance patch (plus some QoL) on their first patch, fixing balance issues. Finally, I love their idea on how to keep the final boss interesting. Here is where I thought it would be terribly unbalanced but in fact it is not and it has produced some very interesting and fun final battles.

It doesn't offer the variance that the obvious comparison, Slay the Spire, has, but that's alright, Wildfrost is still great. Less variance and smaller decks that rotate more often means a better deckbuilding experience - as usual, removing cards from the deck is a rare pleasure, but does significantly alter the gameplay. There seem to be enough routes and strategies to play it for a while.
I've seen other reviews calling the game too hard, which I disagree with. Not only is failure almost always your fault, it isn't *that* hard to beat, but still very challenging which is great. I'm a bit nervous I might be about to unlock everything 'already' after ~20h (which is enough for the low price already) but it will likely leave me wanting a bit more content.
All in all a very good game, probably the 2nd best deckbuilder roguelike I've played after STS

Edit: After dying like 3 times in the final battle in a clear winning position because I failed to read the word BARRAGE I can sympathize a bit more with the aforementioned reviews.","0","1688475655","true","1035","2834","0","72","0","0","0","0"

 I do hope there is more content in the future, or at least make more deck archetypes viable, as some mechanics feel under powered like overburn. I also feel the rng can get in the way of a good run, and I find myself cycling the leaders until I get a decent one, as the final boss is extremely difficult if you don't optimize your deck.

I fully beat the game, the true ending, in about 22 hours which is fine, but I really wanted a reason to keep coming back and sink more time in trying different builds.

For what's it's worth - I consider this game very fair. The difficulty comes from having to keep a lot of interactions and chain reactions in your head at once, but if you can do that, you will sail through this game.

I couldn't find a compelling reason to continue playing after beating the game, and 22 hours  just feels low for a roguelike to me.","0.522293031215667725","1688518736","true","1394","3264","0","7","0","1","0","0"

It's got a very charming art style and aesthetic to the entire game, but the actual deck building and gameplay feels far to rigid and unforgiving, as many other reviewers have pointed out. 

The combat is a really cool twist on deck building combat, almost reminding me of Monster train, where you have different units and cards that can synergize together. However, this game seems to offer extremely limited customization and synergies. Receiving treasure and new units feels far less like 'Which of these is best in my deck?' and moreso, 'Which of these is least detrimental to my deck?'. Enemies feel like they scale far faster than your own, and upgrades are random and extremely sparse.

Overall, I would not recommend this game for somebody that likes to play deck builders trying new strategies, card combinations, or zany runs.","0.513677477836608887","1688510186","false","1158","1229","0","7","0","5","0","0"

Recently I was given the opportunity to try Wildfrost, which instantly captivated me thanks to its promotional art; and even knowing the struggles I would face, I wanted to play it to see what it was like. Wildfrost is, as I already mentioned, a roguelike where we'll undertake an icy adventure to put an end to the eternal winter. Along with the inhabitants of Snowdell, a town of survivors who will lend us their help, and with a wide repertoire of cards in our combat deck, we'll face various enemies that will try to get in our way. 

The gameplay is divided between our stay in the village, where we'll prepare for the adventure and where we'll be able to unlock different cards or companions, and the exploration map, the most prominent part of the game in my opinion. In Snowdell we'll have several establishments, from hot springs to a place to get pets to accompany us, all with their respective uses (mostly unlocking new cards). Some of these stores will improve their services when we complete specific goals related to them; for example, defeating a hundred enemies, doing a certain amount of damage, and things like that. Fulfilling these challenges will unlock new cards, companions, gadgets and even tribes (I'll get to that right away), so it never hurts to keep these goals in mind when we’re exploring.

Touching on the topic of tribes, they are the different factions (so to speak) that we can play with. When starting a game, we'll have to choose between three heroes who will lead our deck (randomized for variety), and whom we must protect since their death will mean our defeat. For this we'll have different cards depending on the tribe to which our character belongs, and their effects will be, in general, unique to that specific tribe. The initial one focuses mostly on inflicting freeze, which slows down enemy turns, for example. This was quite entertaining to me, since the randomization makes the characters and their abilities somewhat diverse, and I thought it was great that there were differences implemented for the different tribes.

As for the exploration map, it is a screen where we can take different paths, selecting squares to advance. When we leave the village we'll have an initial combat available, and when we finish it, two routes will be opened for us to go, showing us what awaits us in each of them. There are several 'events' that will be presented to us along our journey, varying from treasure chests to acquire new cards to possible companions trapped in the ice. It is fairly intuitive but lends itself to strategy, as we have to decide which path will be most beneficial to our game.

Combat is turn-based, with each unit having a respective counter that will indicate when it's time to act will come; when it reaches 'one', specifically. The count depends on each card, and playing any of them will advance the counter, although there may be variables that accelerate or slow it down, such as gadgets or altered states. On the battlefield we can only place cards of units or gadgets (cards that are not units and usually with a turn limit, but that can be very useful) and both we and the opponents will have up to six squares to play on. On the other hand, item or skill cards can be used directly on their target, and all cards, regardless of their type, contribute to the unit counter.

There is a great variety of cards and mechanics that have synergy between them, and building the deck around them is great; I could explain more in depth everything but I would go on and on, the gameplay section is great, what else to say.

The visuals are beautifully adorable, it has a very charming style that left me in awe since I saw it, as I mentioned before. Its 2D cartoonish art is simply brilliant, and it's shamelessly boastful with a charismatic character design. It left me spellbound. The soundtrack is no slouch, boasting very cool, upbeat and exciting tunes, mostly catchy, and fitting the overall game atmosphere very well. It is a very well achieved harmony between both sections, and obviously I found them phenomenal.

In conclusion, Wildfrost is a game that catches your attention through the eyes with a very unique artistic section, and grabs you with entertaining and challenging gameplay. While the game looks very adorable, the plot is quite a bit more serious and its story is slowly unveiled in the form of diary entries, but I can't say much about this as I haven't finished the game yet. I must admit that I found the problem with deck-building roguelikes, and the problem is me; I'm very bad at it, and it is what it is. However, I think it's a beautiful game, with carefully chosen mechanics and neat aspects, and I didn't want to leave it without a recommendation, because I really feel it's a great game and worth a try for fans of the genre.","0.579357445240020752","1688504063","true","528","528","0","107","923","5","1","0"

Just get ready to die your first run if not the next 5 after that. 

Make sure you read all the cards effects and know what actions you can take each turn including the ones that will end your turn and which ones will not. Explore different builds all of them can be very strong. Lastly never level up your companion capacity when given the option your really only need 3 companions and should focus on Buffing them or making sure they work well together.

TLDR: Game is good but hard play it if you like a challenge and read everything in the game (Cards/Charms/Effects)

The art style is awesome and the game itself is quite fun but I cannot beat the third boss and at this point, the unlockables are also beyond my achievement ability so I don't see a point in continuing to play. The incessant dying is exhausting when you can't ever progress past the same point over and over and over. There's also a lot of functions to the cards that are confusing/not explained sufficiently so it's hard to remember what the point of them are, how to apply them and how to use them to your advantage.

A lot of the comments mention difficulty so I went in knowing that. I start my first run and the game looks quite basic and pretty easy. The difficulty ramps up fast. The third boss is usually a major damage check. The mechanics look basic but when combined right, have some beautiful combos. 

The game takes a different layout approach. You fight 6 squares vs 6 squares. You have your main hero and companions you gain along the way. The default action economy is 1 card per turn, but there are ways to change this. (Cards upgrade which don't make them end turns, crowns which allow you to play cards for free in your first turn. Characters and enemies have a countdown until they activate e.g. attack or use an ability. 

You don't fight small battles until you get to a boss. Every fight is a boss battle with waves and unique mechanics. This adds a lot of fun combat without filler battles but allows for little breathing room. Between each boss battle, you get 3 'upgrades' e.g. charms, store, treasure, companions. Charms are permanent power up for cards, treasure are non creature cards. The valid complain some people here make is that you can't really 'steer' your run as much as you might like. I wanted to do shrooms damage for an unlock, well you don't get shrooms cards during your first 6 upgrades. That basically makes a shrooms run near impossible. So you really must run with what the game offers. This can feel a bit limited and rng heavy. 

The combat is brutal. Especially on the later boss fights. You miss one effect on an enemy and suicide your engine or worse, your main hero. BAM, run over. I like the brutality. It gives the game spice. These deaths are not unfair!  You can't just play every fight the same. These enemies have very unique strengths and weakness's!

I don't agree the negative reviews who have 15+ hours in the game  focussing to much on these points. The content is most definitely there for the price. I would like the devs to look into the player agency surrounding the 'building' part. But then again it also drives you to experiment on the fly. Also it seems to me that the ascended player decks are never tougher than the original guardian, since they usually rely on cards. I have only 2 ascended decks yet, but I think this might need a rework.

Last note. The art style is cuddly and cute, but the mechanics are not, lol. You make brutal calls to survive and some decks focus on killing your own units.

There's no real sense of progression or mastery after you unlock the initial rounds of cards and power ups and things, and unlocking those things doesn't really help you win. It just provides more avenues to try and not lose. 

There are so many mechanics that are dependent on getting access to other cards, which is based on luck, so building a deck each time is kind of like participating in a draft tournament. This is true in other deck-based roguelikes as well, but the number of cards in this game that are really clearly meant to go together in a very specific way that then never comes to fruition because you don't have the other half of the combo is frustrating. 

I think something that would improve this game would be a Slay the Spire type addition of relics. Right now, there are boosts (which often come with drawbacks, and are received at random) affixed to specific cards, but deck-based powerups would help a bit. The only thing approaching what I mean are awarded after boss fights, and really are necessary as the enemies level up considerably between zones and the difficulty curve is like running into a brick wall.

Not a bad game, but a frustrating one. Unlikely to pick it up again.

The thumbs-down reviews are mostly along the lines of 'this game is too hard.'   If you only have 10 hours into this game and haven't beaten it yet, i feel like you are out of line giving this game a negative review.  The game is similar to Slay the Spire or Binding of Isaac, where it takes a while to get good at the game.  If anything, this game is much easier than Slay the Spire.  You do have to pay attention to more things at once in this game, compared to other deck builders, but once you get going, the gameplay is very intuitive.  

I almost passed on this game based on the negative reviews stating that it is too hard, as I like to play games like this to relax.  I am glad I didn't, as it is exactly the kind of game that you can play one one monitor while watching Youtube or whatever on the other.

I'll start with the good points of this game:
- it has a very nice design and it suits this game very well
- i like the idea of having different tribes and randomized starting 'Commander'

But that's sadly were the good points end.
They really need to work at the following:
- overall balancing, it's okay when a game is hard, but this game is poorly balanced. The problem is the card design. Every positive effect of your cards gets balanced out with a negative (like needing more time till it is attacking), while most enemy cards don't have this kind of drawback. Therefore winning is mostly luckbased.
- at the moment there are only 3 starting tribes with each having different cards. But sadly most of the time you can't even build around any specific style, because the amounts of card and adventurers you get is really small. Therefore a good deck is again extremly luck based.
- as the tag is telling you, this game is a roguelike, but sadly it does not feel like it. The things you are unlocking barely have any effect on your run and sometimes it makes your runs even harder
- at the moment the game is not worth 20 Bucks, try it for yourself when it's aroun 10 bucks, but it's not worth more

How to improve the game:
- Balance the cards better or implement any kind of algorithm which gives you cards, that suit your deck
- open this game up to the modding community, slay the spire is a good example how crazy the modding community can get and how much better the game can get because of their involvement
- implement items, relics, whatever that are not part of the deck, yes i know there are charm, but to be honest they are often quite useless

At the moment just stay away from the game, it is really not worth it. Just play another round of slay the spire and wait a few more months (or years worse case).","0.477411001920700073","1688308180","false","277","379","0","3","0","4","0","0"

There is ZERO balancing, the cards you get don't even synergize with each-other. Theres all these card themes but you'll never get enough cards in one run to ever make any of them work, half of the cards that give you buffs also give them to the enemy, the turn system is absolutely terrible and also completely off-balance. Its not that the game is too hard, it's just stacked against you. Normally i am fine with this but the game never gives you an opportunity to play smart or even be good. The only way you could possibly win a run is through PURE rng, none of your decision making matters. This game is a total waste of time, going back and playing Slay the Spire would be more entertainment value than trying this game, trust me.

Each run feels unique, and there's a lot of freedom around how you want to play the game. I understand some of the complaints about the game being too difficult (especially around the mechanic where your previous team becomes the new final boss), but I have over 15 completions so far, quite a few with some insane builds, but I have yet to encounter any issues. On the contrary, I would go so far as to say that it is this mechanic that helps separate Wildfrost from other similar games. Beating your previous teams gives you a sense of completion and improvement, and also serves to add variety to the final hurdle.

At the moment it does feel as if there could be a little bit more content in the game, but replayability is still incredible. Additionally, I've seen some of the updates planned for the future and wholeheartedly believe that there are great changes and much more content to come.

-Wildfrost is the newest deckbuilder on the block and it packs quite a punch.  Since it's release almost 3 months ago, it has had quite the polarizing reception.  I'm here to say, that this game is excellent across the board.  I completely understand why some ppl may have had a frustrating experience, but this is my deckbuilder of the year.  It has a very steep learning curve, but it is worth the effort.  The two games that it reminds me most of are Fights in Tight Spaces and Into the Breach.  Like those two games, this is a game of perfect information.  There is of course variation in which cards you pull and which rewards are available, but you always know exactly when your opponents will attack and how much damage they will do.  The only times where you don't know exactly who your opponents will attack is when opponents have aimless.  Having said all of this, there is a lot of information to learn, which is why this game can feel quite unforgiving early on.  It took me about 15 hrs to have my first winning run, and since then, I've had several winning runs and have completed a few of the ascension challenge bells.  

Consensus:
-Excellent Game (Tier 2 and makes ups 25% of my reviews).  Wildfrost is one of my favorite deckbuilders ever and easily my deckbuilder of the year.  This game feels like a hybrid of deckbuilders and tactics games, which is probably why it reminds me so much of Fights in Tight Spaces.  This game is one of the harder games in the genre (the Dailies can be really challenging) but with enough practice, anyone can be successful.  If you love this genre and are eager for your next top tier deckbuilder, Wildfrost is just the game for you.","0","1688233818","true","1371","1504","0","343","0","0","0","0"

1) The ascetics and characters are great. I love how it looks, I love the UI, it's intuitive and easy to play and feels nice. It's a pretty game.

2) It's very tough. You really have to be thinking about every single move and where everyone is and what's gonna happen. This is especially true when there's reactions and chain effects going on: it's easy to lose a run because of something you didn't notice.

3) I love the decision making variety in a battle. I love the fact you can reposition or recall your units without any kind of penalty, I love the redraw system and I think the initiative based system where everyone counts down one action point per action when you play a card is very fun. Very high point of the game.

4) The decision making outside the battles has a lot to be desired. I feel like you're quite restrained in what you're offered between fights. Aside from the first battle, the battles get tough quickly, and I feel like you only get maybe 1-2 companion, 1-2 charms, 1 crown and 1-2 treasures before the first boss. It makes you feel like you haven't grown much from the starting deck, even right at the end. I feel like every time I go into a shop, I can only afford one crown and one card or one charm which is a drag. I wish there were more easier fights with rewards to give you an actual chance to build your deck.

Overall I recommend this game if you liked Slay the Spire or Monster Train, I feel like it's nearly great and it's in my top 3 deck builders of all time. I'm having a lot of fun every time I pick it up, but then I lose and it feels unfair rather than the game beat me fair and square, and I put it down for at least half a day. 

I think with some tweaks to maybe make it easier initially, more gradually build up a deck with more choices offered and add a similar system to Slay the Spire / Monster Train's ascension system so each run you complete gets more gradually harder. I know there is some kind of ascension system but it scales up too hard too quickly.","0","1688233307","true","415","2891","0","6","291","0","0","1"

You're not building a deck around a mechanic in the way you do in games like Slay the Spire.

But once you've understood what the game is, and got to know it a bit, it's a really good game. Great for a quick 20-40 minute bash between other activities.

When I'm having fun, I think this is a great, well made deck builder with a wonderful art style and some fantastic collectable characters and items. 

It is deceptively harder than a lot of other deck builders. The matches  require a lot more focus because there's more enemies and chain reactions to consider, so a lot of the time each turn you have to sit there for a couple of minutes to figure out what's about to happen and how to counter it. Likewise there are more random elements than a lot of other deck builders, which can be minimised with practice, but can be frustrating when your run ends on a coin flip (or even smaller odds).

Instead of pushing the bounds of the genre, developers seemed content to churn out legions upon legions of soulless Slay the Spire clones. Oh look, it's Slay the Spire but with a PARTY. Oh wow, it's Slay the Spire but with LANES.

Monster Train was the standout clone, but aside from that we've had four years of nothing. Game after game came out with promising aesthetics and cool themes, but every time you looked under the hood, it was the same tired trash: a hand of 5 garbage cards and 3 energy to play them with. I began to despair that there would ever be another good deckbuilding roguelike.

And then came Wildfrost. This is, in my opinion, the best deckbuilding roguelike since OG Dreamquest. Now I know I'm in the minority in considering Slay the Spire a wildly overrated game, but if you don't share my radical views, this is still the best deckbuilding rogulike since Slay the Spire and Monster Train. Check out Retromation and Voyix on YouTube to see for yourself.

Everything about this game feels so good, and best of all, it's actually original. If you've been losing hope that anything new can exist in the deckbuilding subgenre of roguelikes—if you've been afraid that drawing 5 cards and playing 3 of them is as good as your life is ever going to get—you absolutely need to buy this game.","0.682091355323791504","1688010557","true","3387","4264","0","29","0","29","2","0"

Then I started to understand the puzzle of it, noticed the weird little cascades of effects, played smarter, started repositioning constantly, never taking a turn without thinking and going into autopilot.... And my god that moment of victory was satisfying.

Yes it took some luck along the way, but finally understanding how much you're on a knife-edge away from defeat almost all the time and really learning to read the board, I've done a bit of a 180 on my thoughts on its difficulty. Yes it is punishing and always fighting back, yes you will sometimes feel it's just impossible, but I really think what's here is a super satisfying puzzle to be learned, and while luck absolutely can and does factor, it really can be mitigated and played around as you learn to read the board, assess the weird chain reactions that happen, and start using them to your advantage.

I open with that because I feel like the difficulty is a lot of the conversation surrounding this game, and with how sudden and sneaky some of the defeats can be, I totally get why it is, but to solely focus on that is to also ignore how wonderfully presented, addictive, genuinely fun and engrossing this thing is. I may have had my annoyances with it on the journey to a single victory but that was just part of the learning process, and having come out of the other end of that journey, I give it a hearty recommendation. It's charming, satisfying, and I look forward to getting more annoyed as I learn to take on even harder runs :)

Edit: After an additional 22 hours of playtime I now have 100% of the achievements; this game's difficulty really is a case of 'you do get better as a player'. I can consistently complete runs now, I can play on higher difficulties, and I can do so with varied and fun combos of different things...

It's not for the faint-hearted; much time and dedication is needed to understand the heart of the these cards. Every decision matters, and every card played can make or break your chances of victory. But you know what? That's exactly what makes it so rewarding. The game doesn't hold back, and in return, it delivers an experience that truly showcases your gaming prowess.

Personally, I was absolutely captivated by the game. From the stunning artwork on the cards to the immersive music, Wildfrost provided an experience that kept me hooked for hours. While I yearned for more cards to collect, one more tribe of playable cards would have been great but overall, it's a solid and incredibly fun game.

Always buy crowns; they are the best item in the game. [spoiler] Don't forget to pick the vase parts once repaired, it can break your combos {in a good way} since it'll double any effect [/spoiler]  

A really fun but difficult game at the start. Start working on finishing the base quests/challenges. Some of the stuff there can really help you get that W. After all that, you should now understand how things interact with each other. [spoiler] Once you unlock The Lumin Vase AKA win 3 times to unlock the bells It gets way easier, you won't have to fight your previous deck. So go crazy with your run, just don't forget to collect the two parts within the shiny events.
Tip: Don't try to buff The Lumin Vase card it won't change it. [/spoiler]
That being said, having bad luck can instantly kill you and there isn't much you can do about it, Teeth charms on enemies are annoying and OP and there is no counter to it.
Here are some tips: When choosing a leader try to go above 7HP since some enemies in the late run can deal 7 HP per hit with aimless, Counters from 3–4 are good, and 5+ are considered high [the enemy will likely attack before you do, so unless the ability is that good don't go above 5]. Having a tank unit is also important unless you are playing Shade Tribe then any summon can do the trick.
Don't forget to buy crowns they are the best item in the game and cost 80g per shop. To make sure you have that amount every time you visit a shop, get kill combos the higher the combo the better however, don't be greedy and let it kill you.

First of all, the game is gorgeous. Probably you are reading reviews because you saw the art of the game and thought: wow, this looks nice! and of course it does. There is a ton of detail on the game and it all makes sense (except maybe the design of the main town which makes you go up and down and the buildings look very similar).

On the design and mechacnics, Wildfrost is quite interesting. You need to manage both your cards and the allies you summon on the board (up to 6), check the turns, what the opponent is doing and it will take you a while to understand all what is within the game, all the status, how each of the abilities work etc...I you have played a lot of card games like I've done you will see no issue here: complexity and variety are usually good things: they bring replayability and allow for different strategies and that's the soul of every good card game.

However, I think Wildfrost has a big issue in terms on how punishing and unforgiving it is. Your main character is always on the field, and if it dies, it's game over. You can do a lot to avoid this to happen, but, as said before, there is a lot going on on each combat, so if you make any small mistake, it is usually game over. And it is very easy to make mistakes because you are constantly pressed and challenged in all combats, and each set of enemies has different strenghts and weaknesses, so you need to try to setup a powerful combo that beats all kind of enemies with a very small set of options that come mostly from RNG (new heroes, cards,shops...) This forces you to rely on 1 or 2 differents approachs, and it limits the creativity a lot. Also, even with a plan, as run is quite short and unforgiving, there is no time to adapt or rebuild: If you do not get great cards on the first events, you are dead. 
On the other hand, you can unblock new cards doing certain achievements ingame, but the games you are not better in the way you would get on Slay of the spire or similar games: They are just other different cards. So progress does not help you winning and soon you are stuck with a set of cards and the same issues than in the first few games.
I think Wildfrost would benefit of longer and more forgiving runs, so you have the chance to experiment and improve,and leave the extreme challenge of a short unforgiving run to the end game. In its current state, and while I enjoyed the game itself, it is a devastating game that wears itself out once you see that you won't get anything better and the only thing left is to crush yourself against a wall over and over until the RNG is good enough for you to win.

The game is hard, never forget that. There are a lot of card interactions that happen when you play a card or combat starts and that can make the game hard to follow. None of it is unfair, it is just hard to follow because so much is going on. Didn't notice that you hitting one enemy with buff the other enemies? Well, you probably lost the run. But when you execute some strategy that helps you just eek out enough damage or survive long enough to win the encounter? That is where the game shines. I had so many little strategies that I had to figure out that the game felt like a puzzle game at times. I could see that I can win, but I really have to plan it out and figure out a strategy I hadn't used before using the tools that I had on hand in the moment.

1. Balance issues - Leaders vary hugely in strength and certain enemies vary too much in strength, its not the biggest issue but it does make the game less enjoyable

2. Variety - there are not enough enemies and not enough items in the game, period. The runs blend together a little too much because of how many characters and items will be shared across runs, it feels a bit stale tbh

3. Super Runs - This is my biggest fun killer tbh, one of the most enjoyable parts of playing roguelikes for me (along with unlocking content) is to get a good run and to have a blast for a minute before I get back to the slog, but this game's final boss mechanic makes me wonder if I should purposefully draft a worse team so that I have an easier time next time, I don't feel like games should disincentivise doing well/winning the game, and the looming feeling of facing the dream team I currently have clouds the fun of my current run.

tldr - I like the game and do think its worth 10-20$, but I won't be able to love the game until they add more content, fixing the balance issues isn't really the most necessary though I think it would be nice, I don't really think they need to change the boss mechanic I just don't enjoy it","0.5","1687557939","true","557","1145","0","4","304","1","0","0"

No matter if you even don't make a single mistake, get a really good team, charms and all that, you still won't be able to beat some groups of enemies. Especially the ones where they gain constantly attack or shield almost every round and start with already shield and high amount of attack, combined with extra attack for each shield they have. Like honestly wtf...you can't even decrease the shield so fast how they regain it, because your cards usually are bad af when you reach those enemies. 

I tried so many different games of this type and I still still play this game but really don't expect to like ever win a run.

Too many runs I've devoted hours to only for it to end because of a single oversight, and its so easy to make a mistake that you'll only ever win by sheer luck. Even the most RNG blessed runs that would be the highlight of any other roguelike only serve as a sour point in this one when the run comes to an abrupt end and just amounts to wasted potential because you couldn't play it flawlessly all the way to the end.

Now you may hear that and think 'challenge accepted' but you truly aren't prepared to analyze every little thing that could change in between every insignificant action you make in this game. You will have to actively fight the urge to go on a string of plays to act out a plan because 2 steps into that plan an enemy will enter the field and give barrage to another enemy that will then one shot your hero. So you have to actively strategize in order to win but you also can't commit to any strategy for more than a turn because the entire dynamic can change on a dime. It makes it so that playing this game right is like trying to pat your head and rub your belly at the same time, except you have to keep it up for hours and if you mess up even for a second you have to start all over again.","0.621494054794311523","1687409396","false","774","1746","0","22","0","11","1","0"

The way the game works is this: you pick a leader card that fights for you, and you recruit other heroes and cards/spells and upgrades along the way. The battles play out on a 6x2 grid split between you and the enemies. The upgrade system is modular, so instead of each card having an upgraded version, you get 'charms' that can upgrade damage, increase effect size, etc. for any of the cards in your deck. The core gameplay loop is fiddling around in between turns to set up kill chains, which is done well and is fun.

The rounds are a lot shorter than STS, and sometimes you hit a wall and die. I don't find the game particularly RNG heavy. I think people are misidentifying some balance issues as RNG. For example (and probably the worst offender), certain leader cards are heavily disadvantaged if you roll the thorns fight, so I never picked them. Once you start to figure this stuff out the game becomes less fun (unlike STS, which becomes more fun the deeper your understanding), but you can easily get 30 hours out of the game if you go in blind.","0.696681320667266846","1687359441","true","2268","2271","0","2","0","19","0","0"

It adopts a slightly different turn-taking style than other deckbuilder games like StS or Monster Train, which I think is why there are so many comments saying it is too difficult. It is challenging, but it emphasises on the roguelike aspect and look you unlock more cards (and strategies) through defeat. 

Yes, it is highly RNG as there are no fixed stats on 'hero' cards, and some runs are definitely harder with low stat heroes. But I think that is one of its strengths as it keeps every run new and different strategies. Information is also provided readily on the cards. Most if not all the times when I make a mistake it was because I did not read the cards properly.

Both music and graphics are good as well. I feel like this game deserves a better rating than what it has currently. It's not really fair for the developers to get their game review bombed because some players hold it up to the known-and-tested deckbuilding card game styles. They are similar as a genre but follow a different set of rules, which is a nice breath of fresh air.","0","1687313174","true","3339","3592","0","26","0","1","0","0"

The game does only have three clans (with cards associated with each clan and other cards that any clan can play), so criticisms about Wildfrost's lack of content are fair, but the cards and their upgrades can interact with each other in fun and sometimes surprising ways. After 100 hours, I'm still finding new plays based on the cards + card upgrades (charms) I find in a run.

The learning curve for Wildfrost is steep and could probably use further tinkering. I don't think I won a run at the lowest difficulty until I was 10 hours in, so if your enjoyment of a game is wed to winning the game, then Wildfrost may not be for you. Personally, I'm still enjoying Wildfrost even on my losing runs as I can usually look back on a run and see where I went wrong with the deckbuilding or with my approach to a boss. The more runs I attempt in Wildfrost, the stronger my decks feel thanks to learning from my past mistakes and successes.

- Amazing artstyle, bright and charming, tons of personality, wholesome, my favorite type of aesthetic
- Surprisingly deep, turn order plus two lanes make it really fun to think out turns but not overwhelming
- The only roguelike deckbuilder I've been willing to actually get good at, was never good at them before but this was worth it
- For me personally, Wildfrost is way better than anything else I've played in the genre.  That includes Slay the Spire, Inscryption, Dicey Dungeons, any of the various Hearthstone modes.  I liked it more than FTL and Into the Breach (although they aren't deckbuilders ofc).  Honestly maybe my favorite roguelike overall, although I'd have to look back through a list to be sure.
- Everything works perfectly, no bugs, super convenient UI, every aspect is fun, etc

Nothing bad about it.  Played it nonstop for 4 weeks until I (almost) 100%'d it.  Wish there was more is the only thing I can say about it, I will buy every expansion.



EDIT - Just 100%'d this game.  It's a 10 out of 10 for me.
Just so wholesome and bright and enjoyable.  Of course the strategical elements are unique, creative, and engaging as well but the aesthetic really puts it above any of the other games for me.

The game is challenging but never feels unfair and I've never been frustrated to lose a run, it's always been a case of 'Shucks, I didn't think this one through enough!' 
I also think at least part of the reason why I'm enjoying Wildfrost so much more than any other card-based roguelike is that you don't really have to deal with chance-based calculations all that much - the decks are always pretty small and you always know many turns in advance how the characters are going to attack each other. You just have to plan out the right decisions without worrying too much about drawing the right cards at the right time.

Best part about the game:
1. One full run takes around 1hr and 20 mins which is really good for me.
2. There are 3 different deck build that further branches out into more diversity in builds because they all have different set of card pool.


The only problem I see is:
1. After patch, Makoko is still a FUN killer. The enemy single handedly limits the deck combo that you can play. If your deck is too slow, you lose. Such a piece of garbage card. DEVS, increase the counter on that card FFS. 

2. Teeth charm on enemies should be 3, MAX. 4 is BS. Leader on average has 8 health so that's another problem. It doesn't make sense considering it could appear in the early stages of the game and there are enemies with 8 health that could potentially get it.

The difficulty is not subtle. 

This is not a game in which you can expect to win every time you sit down to play, but you can expect to learn something every session.  Wildfrost elegantly combines intuitive systems that feel simple on the surface but interact in very deep ways, and while the game may not have legs for hundreds of hours, the first 40-50 were (for me) full of lateral thinking and subsequent light bulb moments. 

One criticism (or something I perhaps miss from other games in this genre) is that turn and card economy are fairly strict and it's not often that you get to watch your synergies truly cascade, but when it does it is super satisfying.  Nonetheless Wildfrost is a fun, very fairly priced and refreshingly chaotic take on a genre that's threatening to become more formulaic.","0","1687138615","true","3324","6225","0","2","0","1","0","1"

2. All decisions in the game are VERY simple. Deck building also feels too easy. 
3. Too little randomness in the runs. All runs feel the same
4. No way to start a 'fresh save'. I fucked up my first expedition and wanted to do a 'no death run', cos already felt that i could do it after 1 hour into the game, but could not erase my safe file

That being said after at least 10 or 15 tries just to get past the first boss it clicked and I haven't lost to that boss since. This is a game that takes a lot of time to get used to, but once you do it really is addicting. 

The rng on the starting leaders you get really could be better. There have been times that all 3 they give you to pick from have had either very low health or really bad trigger effects. This doesn't always mean you will auto lose as a lot of the cards you get from chests and followers from the icebergs can be a lot more defining for the run. But it does still put you at a disadvantage. There are a few other issues I have with the rng like when it comes to the buffed enemies you fight after completing your first run.

Overall I love this game and its unique counter system. I think it adds a lot of depth to the game. The art style is adorable and fun to look at and the music is a straight up bop, although it can get repetitive. The runs are a bit short since there are only 3 areas each with their own respective final boss. But the challenges to unlock new items, charms and followers keep it fairly fresh!

You don't need a high roll deck to win on any difficulty, it is enough to get a decent deck. And this game gives you so many options to build good decks. 
The game is hard at the beginning, but the real difficulty lies in you having to plan ahead for the next few turns and also  having to pay attention to what the enemies can do. For example, one enemy has the ability to always attack if another attacks. If you overlook this, you might just get demolished once another multi hit enemy attacks, triggering that multiple times. You also know exactly what an enemy will do in like 3 turns, so you might want to prepare beforehand and not just on the turn when it might already be too late.

I really like the smooth and focused gameplay, similar to Monster Train and Slay the Spire. Many card battlers have unnecessary elements that feel clunky and useless, leading you to feel like you waste your time on animations or features that you don't need nor want. This is well done here.
The 3 different and unique classes with around 3 different builds each are quite nice. Every class has usually one general style, so mixing the builds together works well. For example, you could have a snowball and poison build, because the snowballs stall them while the poison does its job. The fights and enemies are also fun.
The one feature this game has that I wish more card battlers have is that increasing the difficulty also gives you some benefits. It is such a small, but cool thing that it is harder, but also gives me more money, so I can purchase more things and get builds that would otherwise be too expensive. That actually makes you want to play on harder difficulties.

About the negatives, the random generation of your start hero is an interesting idea, but I wish that it had better rules for that. Some just really suck or are super boring while others start out pretty strong. Better balancing would be good there, but it is not a deal breaker, it doesn't happen too often that all options suck and then you can just start -> concede -> restart.","0","1687034153","true","1563","3619","0","8","0","0","0","0"

Slay the Spire was getting stale but this does more then fill the void. The synergies are well developed and silly to explore. Yes - It is hard and not every game is winnable. You really have to focus your build around the final bosses similar to fighting A20 Heart. Since unlocking all the bells, I love the challenge and pulling off a funky build is really satisfying 

Now I would say the only complaint is sometimes the new heroes you have to select from are lack luster. Additionally, being forced down a pathway to buy the lumen goop components really sucks sometimes - I wish it was at the starting nodes so it didn't dictate that decision making.","0.545454561710357666","1682507496","true","1546","16516","0","5","0","2","0","0"

I probably play this too fast. I know this.

The thing is: this game will kill you a lot, and it will almost always be 'I could have survived if I'd noticed that one icon on a card somewhere.'

This is the problem: the game demands perfect perception of you all the time, and punishes you by ending runs if you miss any small detail, even ones you have not previously encountered or foreseen.  Unfortunately, it also makes that perception super difficult in a lot of ways - a lot of card effects are obfuscated as icons on cards that are easy to overlook (looking at you, fog).  A lot of effects that have common (or at least, common enough) name types in other games are named other things here (looking at you, teeth, shroom, etc) - it stacks up to be a game that demands much of the player. 

More than I had to give and still find the fun in it.

The twist at the end is very interesting and it's gonna make playing more quite the challenge.

Some key mechanics differ which make for a very refreshing brain-bender of a game, with a large focus on tactical decisions and calculations.

Key features:
- Redrawing not every turn (à la StS or Monster Train), but only every other few turns.
- No 'energy' to play cards, but a simple one-card-per-turn system.
- A tactical grid, on which creatures 'count down' until they attack, with each card played resulting in a field-wide countdown.

What frustrated me is that there is no preview of turn results (after all the creatures count down), often leading to me dying because I missed a mid-turn effect resulting in a death on my side. In this game, mistakes are punishing and you have to think carefully about the timing of your movement and cards, because of the countdown mechanic. However, it is very fresh gameplay-wise.

Overall, love this game. Currently finally winstreaking on the true ending (can I call my first time two wins in a row 'winstreaking'? LOL). There is not that much content, but the presentation and game mechanics are top notch.","0","1686856504","true","2028","2029","0","14","202","0","0","0"

Slay the spire is a lot more difficult than this, yet the top review states he is max level at it and thinks that way. I cannot even fathom how you would get to that conclusion when i am having trouble not beating the game more often than i lose without too much thought honestly.

To win Slay the Spire on max difficulty (which i never reached truth be told) i would need a SERIOUS strategy. Slay the Spire is a lot more rigid and min/max dependent in that way. I think Wildfrost is quite a bit more casual and with just the few choices after the first or second battles you can follow whatever strategy is presented to you and have very high chances of winning.

Might fail 1/20 runs due to pure randomness though i guess (thorn guy being in the back row for the most part i would say). But that's really not what i would call pure randomness screwing you over. Failing a run because of randomness is really not something i would overly charge this game with. Yes, it is more random in a way. But it's also generally easier and you have enough wiggle room for that randomness not to be unfair in most scenarios.

I have beaten the game with idk 10 different strategies or so and while some definitely feel more consistent it is usually possible to formulate a strategy after the first battle and its rewards. The main thing for having a consistent game is just going with snoof as pet i would say. I didn't even try some of the pets because they would just seem to suck in every strategy i could try.

There are a good amount of fun ways to play and reasonable unlock paths/challenges. I do agree in one point mentioned: starting heroes suck lots of times. Some are really good though. Most of the time your main figure is one your other companions though. Just having HP on your starting hero and not letting him die is generally enough.

This game clearly does not have the quality of the insanely polished Slay the Spire, but should be a no-brainer to pick up for every fan of that game. It is in the exact same genre, does pretty well overall, does not require perfect strategy and should be a nice, but also very doable, challenge to beat for most people.","0","1686834244","true","3398","3398","0","38","464","1","0","0"

If you wish Slay the Spire was snappier, more aesthetic, and felt less grindy, then this game is perfect for you. Personally, I much prefer it to other roguelike deckbuilders I've played. The mechanics are simple, legible, and can lead almost any run to turn into a 'broken combo' which, if you've played Monster Train, you'll know is an amazing feeling. However, as easy as it is to get a crazy combo going, it can also end just as quickly. The relatively small size of the main character's health pool (as it is a renewable resource) makes sense for the balance of the game, however it also means that any given turn can be your last if you make a simple mistake.

While I have won and lost my fair share of runs, the losses rarely felt like an oversight of my long-term strategy or poor hand management, but instead the consequences of stupid mistakes (being unaware of enemy charms, forgetting about smackback, accidentally putting characters in the wrong order, etc). I think the game would benefit a great deal from an option to run-back a lost combat a single time with the same RNG seed (like Across the Obelisk) as I believe this would alleviate a lot of people's frustration with the game.

However, that's my only real critique and with that out of the way, I want to really emphasize how good this game is: The art is obviously fantastic. The soundtrack is simple but extremely solid and it's integration into the game play really brings the vibes up as soon as first-blood is drawn. The meta progression is simple, manageable, and relatively fast (with a few exceptions) and since it's all achievement based, you're forced to experiment with the full range of mechanics if you want to keep unlocking new cards. And the mechanics are very finely tuned and fun. Every card has great synergy potential in multiple ways, the charms and certain cards are all really game-changing in different ways that make you think 'ooooh, next time I want to see what happens if I can get this card and that charm and...' Wildfrost oozes replayability (some of which I won't spoil here) and is extremely polished.

Solid 9/10 would recommend to anyone, regardless of their prior experience with the genre.","0.513808965682983398","1686727310","true","1464","1700","0","15","0","1","0","0"

It's a clear indicator that the developers are amateurish, thin-skinned egotists. I attempted to voice my negative opinions on the game in the forums and the devs repeatedly deleted my threads claiming they weren't 'useful' or 'informative'. So, I attempted to reply to all other threads voicing the same complaints, sarcastically informing them the game is actually perfect. That bumped a slew of these threads to the top, and the devs didn't like that, so they they permabanned me.  With that out of the way, back to my original review:

So you like Deckbuilders? Played Slay the Spire and Moster Train into the ground? Do yourself a favor and DON'T BOTHER WITH WILDFROST.

No matter what you read on the community tab, you are effectively playing a slot machine with a coating of Tumblr art plastered over it. Anyone claiming otherwise is lying through their teeth. There is very little agency given to the player over what cards/charms are made available. It's either entirely chance or a pick between three choices, and if those all suck you might as well abandon the attempt right then and there. It is MANDATORY that you get good loot RNG and then play near perfectly ONLY AFTER THAT if you even hope to have a winning run. That is literally the only path to a win condition. If the game doesn't feed you good cards, no amount of 1000 IQ plays will compensate.

It's like someone far smarter than the Devs came up with the core game mechanics, then the Devs implemented every one of those mechanics in the most frustrating, unfair, unintuitive, non-player friendly ways possible.","0.44176134467124939","1685993397","false","712","775","0","21","721","2","3","0"

Wildfrost is a seriously great game. I only have ten hours in it myself, but I've watched many more hours of other people playing it. It's well worth the money, and if (like me) you have a lot of experience with other turn-based tactics/deck-builder games you'll probably be able to jump right in and understand most of the mechanics right away. But even if you're new, the tutorial does a pretty decent job of explaining the basics.

Wildfrost is good. I recommend it if you like card roguelikes.

Like the other reviews are saying, this game has a very low margin for error, and quite a learning curve. However, I do not think many aspects of the game are unfair. There are only a handful of fights in the game I could complain about (yetis and cats), but nothing is so insurmountable that you're screwed without just the right card for the job.

The game has minor balance issues for the most part with its cards and charms, but I have faith that these will be addressed as the game receives updates. The first update has already done good work in that regard.

My biggest gripe overall lies with the true final boss; not the fight itself, but rather how limiting it feels to have aspects of your run decided for you as you have to go the path that holds each piece, and you often have to forgo any other possible benefit from the events the pieces are in to acquire them. This is one of those aspects that feels unfair.

But that's my only big criticism, and again, updates are on the way. This game has been one of my favorites of the year so far, and I look forward to where it goes from here.","0.545454561710357666","1681638649","true","926","4540","0","13","211","3","0","0"

Wildfrost is not difficult per se - it's all about learning and trying all over again. It has nice visuals and is a bit cute.

BUT! The main issue is that many things you get during your runs are incompatible. Companion skills might contradict each other or even kill your entire party if you are not careful. The same goes for cards... and that's how you get screwed. Also, there is not much variety in what you can do before each boss fight.

To sum up, it offers you a certain level of challenge and can keep you busy for some time, but don't expect too much.","0","1686518100","true","1049","1190","0","34","0","0","0","0"

1. the Game is pretty Small, i played for 10 Hours and i feel like i unlocked everything that is not stupidly Luck based (example: get a 6x kill combo for a pet. the whole field need to be full and u need to kill everything in one turn.) there are 'only' 3 tribes and the events, the Fights and Items are after 3 runs just the same.

2. Unbalanced. The tribes are not really balanced, i feel like i have only with one of them a chance to get to the final Boss and some bossfights are also just luck based. If the have the wrong enemys or u pull the wrong Cards, u lose. Yes it is a luck game, bit Slay the Spire with a similar concept did it way better.

3. repetetive. Like i said, after 3-5 runs it was just the same over and over again. The leader says what build from like 4 u will play and then u get the same bosses again, the same items and the same Chars again. yes u can unlock like 5 Chars, Items and Pets but yeah thats not that much.

4. The Final Boss. The Final Boss is stupid. In every run after my 5th i get there and i never have the thought that i can win. This is so stupid strong, he has like 60-80 HP and every HP he loses he and EVERY of his allies gets this as attack boni. How should u win when the fucking field is always full and everything just one hits you? 

If you like a small game with some bullshit luckbased fight, then play it. The game could have been really cool, but yeah. I regret buying it

Okay, I've beaten the game. There's a lot to love, and I'll give it a thumbs up, but its still a very frustrating design. I would say that out of the 35 hours played, about 10 were miserable in some shape or form. 

Pros:
+++Lovely visuals
++its just plain fun to interact with
+some really interesting combinations with the cards

Cons:
-very high mental load. Expect to die due to a minor slip up (alt-f4ing not withstanding)
-every aspect is in the enemies favor. This does get easier once you can get to two bells of difficulty, but it feels like a slog
-Some of the fights have incredibly high variability (aimless fog cats), where in with certain arrangements of the starting enemies outright kill low health decks.
-due to the drafting RNG, it can feel totally out of your hands for some of those fight. There's a certain joy to that struggle, but it feels more like a slot machine in its results than something you can plan around. (some of this is intentional, with clunkers being harder to play overall)

Flaws:
-a lot of the cards have very narrow use cases that don't become clear until you run into the case. ie, I had two full games where gigi's cookie box felt useless, and there was no clear reason why (it requires a wooden unit WITH a turn timer AND damage). since this isn't made clear, you just end up feeling confused
-some of the actions have unclear outcomes (ie, spawning a copy will spawn in front if there's room, but will push your unit down if the row is full. This can easily kill a run). Would love to see some UI love to indicate what's happening
-given the severity of thorns, it would be nice if there was some clarity added, like pulsing red borders around targets with thorns, or 'Will die' indicators for non-aimless actions. Just to reduce the mental load a wee bit

Overall, I love it for its hardcore elements, and i'm immensely frustrated by some of the design choices. Comparing it to monster train, both have a very high difficulty, but monster train lets you opt into some of the crazier bits (ie, thorns in monster train is usually applied to a battle as an optional challenge, instead of being something you'll randomly need to deal with)","0.433070838451385498","1681627444","true","148","2555","0","56","0","0","0","0"

Cute graphics, smooth animation, and lots of depth with all the mechanics involved. However there are a few things under the surface that are very frustrating.

1) By far the most frustrating issue is the unclear, sometimes even bugged interactions between some of the cards and charms. While most work as expected, there are still a decent chunk of interactions whose behavior is unclear until it causes you a misplay or loss. There are only so many times this can happen before the player quits out of sheer frustration.

2) Lack of preview for actions. Many times my lead or other card dies because I did not fully comprehend the board. Other times adding a charm does not change a card in the way I expect it to. It's very annoying to spend 40 minutes in a run only for it to be tossed because of this. There needs to be some kind of preview to warn you if your unit is about to die. For adding charms, there needs to be a preview to show you what the final product is.

3) Random leads. You can pick from 3 randomly generated leads at the start of each run, each having random stats and effects. Unfortunately, you could just roll 3 garbage leads. A reroll option needs to be added so you don't need to spend time starting and ending runs immediately after just to reroll.

4) Lack of scaling and synergies offered. A decent chunk of games never get anywhere because the game does not offer you anything. The game might decide to give you an unusable charm. Or it might offer you cards that have no synergy with your deck. With how fast the enemies scale, scaling and synergies of your own are necessary to even have a chance. I'm not saying to give me exactly what I need every time, but at least give me something I can use.

The potential is there. But the game is very frustrating at this point because of these issues. I really did try to give this the benefit of the doubt as much as possible, to the point where I gave it 38 hours. But this game should have been released as early access. More time needs to be spent providing more clarity and fixing bugs. It is clearly not yet ready for a full release.","0.517312765121459961","1685853743","false","800","2334","0","38","0","2","0","0"

I see some reviews saying it's too difficult and others say it becomes easy once you master it... I agree with neither. Every run is completely different depending on your build. Except, maybe the first two minibosses which are usually beatable with most builds. Once you understand the mechanics it gets *easier* but not easy.
I do wish they come up with more content, like different battles and different leader classes.

On another topic, I love the art in this so much - most other deckbuilders are, sorry to say, super unappealing.

The game looks like it was drawn by Pendleton Ward and plays like it was designed by the Jigsaw Killer.

Where deckbuilders like Slay the Spire and Monster Train are built to be broken, Wildfrost is built to break you. The core gameplay loop revolves around managing your action economy: You play a card, everyone's action counters tick down and the units who hit zero activate and attack. Enemies (almost always) move first and playing one card (usually) ends your turn, which creates a combat system with a lot of moving parts that will mercilessly punish misplays.

A single mistake is enough to send a you spiraling, which makes every combat encounter feel like a potential run-ender and makes every victory feel earned. Unfortunately, this is also the game's biggest weakness.

Wildfrost contains a ton of pieces that feel like they should work together to create interesting synergies, but the mechanics the player is allowed to interface with run-to-run are very limited. Enemy encounters are designed with an wide variety of synergies which makes navigating them an interesting challenge, but the player is never given access to the same toolbox.

This leaves most runs feeling vulnerable to unstoppable encounters with no consistent strategy to play around them, with the spike cat and shield crab encounters being the most notorious in my mind. On occasion, Wildfrost will throw in a boss that just... turns off a core gameplay mechanic you would otherwise leverage to play around the encounter.

When it's at its best its fantastic, but when its at its worst its infuriating. Wildfrost is the kind of game that feels like beating your head against a brick wall until, bit by bit, the bricks come loose and the entire thing finally comes crumbling down. It's a great experience when it's over, but you're going to lose a lot of hair in the process.



6/8/23 Update: As of the latest update, a number of balance and quality-of-life changes have smoothed out the difficulty curve and made many of the mechanics of the game more intuitive and accessible.

That said, I still feel like the balance overhaul fails to address the fundamental issue I had with the game, which is the lack of player agency in 'building' a run. The randomly generated heroes leave a large portion of your run up to the mercy of the draw, and more often than not I've found myself disadvantaged in the early-to-mid game because I drafted a sub-par hero.

This is compounded by an upgrade system that feels artificially restricted. Little things like being unable to place an upgrade that includes the 'consume' keyword on a card where the keyword is already present or being unable to assign charm-based combat modifiers like 'barrage' to cards with zero attack put some of the more interesting synergies I can see in this combat system (because it is a very interesting system!) out of reach.","0.60909569263458252","1683295691","true","1533","7027","0","3","0","7","0","0"

The theme shouldn't fool you, though; the game is tough, and as others have written, one mistake can ruin your run. However, as someone short on time for games, I haven't found this too frustrating, as a successful run only takes about an hour anyway, so you've never really lost much progress. It's true that some runs will be better than others based on the luck of your draws (though, I think this is true for most roguelikes), but I've found that as I've become better acquainted with the card pool and the enemy fights, there've been less more run-ending technical mistakes and more room for higher-level strategic decisions. So, the longevity to the game is definitely there. I'd agree with other reviewers that for new players the best place to start is focusing on winning one battle at a time. Overall, this game checks a lot of boxes for me, and I'm happy to recommend it.","0","1686311648","true","1680","1836","0","6","0","0","0","0"

Sure, it's difficult, but not overwhelmingly so, if you've played deckbuilders before. Admittedly, you can lose in frustrating ways, or because you didn't quite parse the board, or if you dragged the mouse too fast, or if you forgot to move a unit before you played a card.

Many reviews for this game compare difficulty to or mention their experience with Slay the Spire/ Monster Train and complain about difficulty or reduced freedom in run progression. Those reviews miss that Wildfrost has completely different mechanics compared to those two, and it's insane to think that your hours in either make you qualified to say this game is too hard if you refuse to change your approach. Wildfrost rewards thinking about each decision you make, so you will suffer if you try to play quickly. Especially towards the end of a run, a single misplay will result in defeat. That certainly doesn't make Wildfrost a bad game- it's turn-based, you can just think your actions through. 

The only thing I can think of that would improve the game is a combat preview functionality, where it would display a warning over allies that will be defeated this turn, or some type of display to show how much health each unit will have after the turn resolves. 

In short, Wildfrost is one of the best roguelikes I've played, and due to it being one that you have a deck in, it is often compared to Slay the Spire. It's insulting to compare the two, not because either game is bad- both are fantastic, but because the games are fundamentally different. Saying the game is too hard is a genuine skill issue.","0","1686157893","true","464","1033","0","19","0","0","0","0"

You get what you start with and need to make the best of it, which might allow you to think outside of the box.
Take some time to think about each play before you make it, simple.

Now with that out of the way, learning the game can take sometime at first, I think that makes it rewarding in terms of feeding your brain. Chuckle Fish made a banger which was Starbound, I knew I had to buy this because I trust the team and card games have been my kick lately.
And they didn't disappoint.

The game is perfectly balanced, it's just a skill issue for a lot of players who are too lazy to learn something out of their comfort zone.

The music, the graphics, the card interface, the charms system, and the overall presentation are top notch. That said, I would be very hard pressed to ever recommend this game.

It's not that the game is 'hard'. The issue is that all the difficulty comes from things the player cannot possibly prepare for.

-It's entirely possible to have a party wipe on the first boss, and there's nothing you can do about it. Other times, the battle will be a breeze. There's no power-ups available at this point — it's largely luck of the draw.
-You don't get to determine which leaders are available to pick from, only which of the three random selections you pick. Did you want to play with a certain deck again this round? Too bad, you only have the other two available.
-It's impossible to prepare too far in advance, because each map is punctuated by the battle. Perhaps you take a path to get a recruit planning to get more items in the next area, but then the next area has nothing but additional recruits and a shop you can't afford to get anything at. There's no way to know, because the map beyond each battle isn't visible until the battle is over (assuming you manage to survive it).
-You also can't control which set of enemies you're up against. There's no branching paths; you just get a random group each time. Despite the recent update showing the name, it's still very challenging to prepare for these adequately since there's no way to know which paths lie past the current area.
-The recent card balancing, while it has brought improvements, seems to have made the game more challenging overall.
-Progression is minimal. You get a couple of upgrades fairly quickly, then they slow wayyy down. I enjoy completing games, but I think I might have to ultimately quit on this one due to the sheer amount of luck involved. Charms, which I really love the style of, are very hard to unlock, and even harder to earn during a run. Within a single run, the number of times you can upgrade is extremely limited.

I'm still enjoying my time for now, but it is certainly not a game for everyone.","0.546807527542114258","1685607674","false","683","3354","0","296","2484","10","0","0"

I do like the cards and the potential decks you can build but it is nearly impossible to do a build you want. There are far too few selection events for items, charms, and survivors. I see these cool abilities like the poison and bruise mechanic and I have a desire to stack them but everytime I get one character or item of the type I never get another. You can't buy survivors at shops or [strike] choose what type of charm you are buying [/strike] [i] you can choose what charms once you unlock the charm shop which I didn't unlock until having over 24 hrs of playtime [/i]. The starting heros are worthless 80% of the time. There are only 2 or 3 viable strategies (stacking bruise, acorns, and poison).  I honestly think if there were either combat rewards or more reward screens in general this game would be 10x more casual player friendly. I don't plan on stopping until I beat the game but currently I do not see any way that it will happen in a satisfying way. RNG victories are kinda lame.

UPDATE: I have beaten the game and my opinion still stands. I got completely lucky with the build I used. I stacked acorns and was lucky enough to not face a tooth enemy or Moko so my victory by 1000 cuts worked. All around not satisfying and this game lacks the extreme replayability of StS and other deck builders. As frustrating as this game was, it did help kill time at work a lot and I do look forward to coming back in the future once more stuff is added and reworked.","0.544701814651489258","1686028812","false","1439","3192","68","7","124","10","2","0"

The game needs minor tweaks but is soon to be receiving them.

After 10hrs I beat the games normal ending, after 30hrs, the true ending. I have still not collected everything as of this review

Positives: 
-Very good art, the game is wonderful too look at
-Challenging card game play. Each encounter is like a puzzle to solve with many ways to approach.
-Re-playable. Dying is part of the cycle of game play.
-Unique combat something between Slay the Spire and Darkest Dungeon

Neutrals/Preferences:
-The game is hard and a card game. SOMETIMES you do just get unlucky and die or forced into a situation where winning and losing is just up to chance
-The game is a Rougelite, as you play you gain more knowledge and things to help you win. Your first runs are harder then your later ones


Negatives: 
The games needs a few tweaks. Sometimes the game just has annoying encounters or mechanics that currently you just have to deal with

(EDIT: Since the 1.0.5 update these no longer apply, see comments) 
-As you play the game you will find there are factions. Sometimes your build is just hard counted by that faction and there is no way to foresee that happening until it is too late. 
-Some of the characters/cards that you can get during your run are simply not great. Nothing is useless but some of the worst examples would be Ice Dice which is pure luck and other cards with weak/situational effects

The devs are already talking about a re-balance of some of the weaker cards
A fix for the faction issue is giving the player more information about what they are about to fight (EDIT: They did change them)

Overall the game is very much worth the price and playing through for its charm and game play

In the end I don't think it matters. I have never finished Spelunky, but it's not a game I feel I need to win because moment to moment gameplay makes the runs imo. This game feels the same.

Edit: The run right after this initial review (at 5.3 hours) I beat a run for the first time. Nailbitingly (I won with 1hp) close but it felt fair.

Edit 2: Finally completed my second run, only 34 hours to do so. My former winning run should never have been thorns for my sanity.

Edit 3: Okay, so basically only a small period of time after my second win, I got the 3rd and then final (secret boss) win soon after, only losing a couple games in between. I think the game gets [b] soooo much easier with each successive modifier [/b] past the first one, as getting the second crown immediately allows for much smoother deckbuilding experience early on. I hope the creators are able to better balance the first 2 wins, because it can really be a pain to get past both of those. Regardless, my original verdict still stands. It's a fair game and very fun.","0","1681853420","true","318","2477","0","25","0","0","0","0"

I'll come back with an update after I play more!

After nearly 48 hours of play, 110 runs and only one victory, I can't recommend Wildfrost in its current state. The game is painful to play at times, frequently killing you in the first few stages because you're given pathetic cards to start the game with. The leaders and pet cards are woefully underpowered, and there are too few options for leaders to begin the game. I wish they'd at least allow you to choose a faction first, then select one of three leaders from a faction you enjoy playing. The inability to skip cards along your journey also frequently leads to a bloated deck that stands no chance of winning as you watch your synergy slowly fall apart (if you ever even got that far to begin with). I've put so much effort into this game because I love the mechanics, the music, and the art style. Wildfrost is truly unique and stands out from other roguelike deckbuilders, and I really want to love this game. If the developers are willing to makes some changes to balance the game and create a more gradual difficulty curve, I'll be happy to change this to a positive review, because I believe this game deserves it. But I can't recommend other players subject themselves to this brutal, punishing, unfair game.","0.419580399990081787","1682924285","true","2829","5462","0","2","0","0","0","1"

Problem Exists Between Keyboard and Mouse

That's the best way to describe all these negative reviews.  A bunch of softy participation award whiners that can't be bothered to overcome the slightest amount of difficulty in a game.  This is not some massively hard game, I had beaten my first run within a couple hours of playing and I'm not some savant or anything, I'd even argue it takes me longer to learn games than most the good players.

If people are spending twenty or thirty hours and can't get their first win then they're banging their head against a brick wall the same way each time expecting different results.  This is a game where if you lost, YOU are the reason you lost.  Is it unforgiving?  Yes!  But if that's a reason to negatively review a game that is otherwise incredible, then why would any of the Soulsborne Ring games not get the same treatment?

Fact of the matter is this is the best deckbuilding roguelite since Slay the Spire and Monster Train hands down, it isn't even close.  If the devs continue to improve it and add content I could even see it surpassing these games.

The Good:
- Well balanced, all the different status mechanics feel useful/viable to build around (teeth and smackback possibly being a little too strong).
- Positioning and unit turn counter mechanics are novel and really add another element to the usual formula.
- Great artstyle, setting and music.
- Legitimately threatening but manageable boss mechanics that can wipe the floor with you if you don't manage them well.
- Nice daily run system that seems to always start you off with a fairly strong starter character ability to build around + novel modifiers on the run that you can't get on normal runs.

The Bad:
- Fairly low card variety though this will presumably increase with future content.
- Content unlock mechanics are a bit arbitrary and also there just isn't that much to unlock. The town is nice but each building just presents you with a small list of challenges to unlock cards/charms/nodes after which they're obsolete. Feels a bit tacked on without much thought.

The Ugly:
- The aforementioned lack of variety is particularly noticeable with bosses/minibosses, each region could probably have used a few more, though again this will hopefully change with future content.
- Runs being fairly short and your limited ability to remove cards from your deck (you can probably only reliably remove 2-4 each run) mean this is very strongly a 'make the best of what you get' kind of game, not necessarily a bad thing but you have to roll with it.","0","1685932140","true","633","1776","0","26","101","0","0","0"

I was expecting something Slay the Spireish in terms of building up your deck where you have choices and chances to make to build your team up.  Instead you get a single choice between exactly 2 paths that have two or three spots each and contain almost the same thing.

Something I have found out through playing it however is actually the difficulty modifiers give positive effects.
And these positive boons actually go a long way to giving more player agency and fixing some of the common complaints of the game.

Love the artstyle and world. This game will make you feel smart when you clean up an encounter or even just manage to scrap by.

This review was written after getting 100% (16/16) achievements.


Wildfrost is currently the most charming card game out there. 

The art is most certainly the best I have seen in any card game. The art style is cute, colorful and absolutely oozes with character. Everything fits together; the heroes, the companions, the items, the enemies, the music - absolutely EVERYTHING.

I invite anyone to go this game's wiki and take a look at the card art. The art style and OST were enough, by themselves, to make me want to buy the game at launch.

Now, the other important part of a great game - the gameplay and the mechanics.

Wilfrost has a unique turn timer where instead of having 'mana' to play x amount of cards each turn, everything in the board has a countdown that changes once you play a card. Thus, while there is a lot less going on in a single turn, the game leads you to think out your next move very carefully.

The other main mechanic is the ability to move your player cards in the 3x2 grid, choosing what lane the enemy will attack or who you are attacking. This way, you avoid relevant damage to your hero, since when it dies, you lose the run.

The final main mechanic in this game are card effects - some of the effects are teeth (thorns), demonize (double damage), bom (increase damage on hit) and frenzy (multiple attacks). Because of the nature of these effects, there is a wide variety of interactions between them, leading to really fun synergies.

So, with how these mechanics work, you end up with a really steep learning curve. Countdowns mean that a lot of enemies can act at the same time, interacting with each other and punishing players that aren't careful. The lack of actions per turn mean that a wrong move can be fatal, dooming the run on a single misplay, especially on later fights. 

However, this does not mean that the game is unbalanced. I have seen many complaints from 'card game veterans' that 'play Slay the Spire on A20' and still suck at this game. This is the fault of the player's mentality and not the game - Wildfrost is more of a strategy game than a Deck Builder, meaning that the way you play mid fight being is WAY more important than your deck building choices. I have beaten the A20 heart with every character and achieved 100% in StS in less than 200 hours - it is painfully obvious that these games are different, but people still claim that it is this game's fault.

You can win very consistently in this game - I have seen 20-30+ streaks on twitch with the most varied decks and strategies, and I am not even surprised. Even I got the 3 win streak achievement in 60 hours of fooling around! TLDR - Most of the complains are legit skill issues. Now, onto the grading.

Despite the StS-like structure, there aren't really THAT many unlocks or forks on your future way. You also rarely can choose charms (card upgrades) to pick. Your strategy will mostly revolve around heroes and very limited additional cards you pick up on your way.

Most importantly, in this game, you can't skip rewards and additional card choices. Which means that every step forward is a chance to dilute your deck with a non-essential ability. This is balanced by the fact that you draw a lot of cards and can redraw them before all are spent. And it's an interesting way to approach a deckbuilder.

Enemy power ramps up quickly (those damn boars), and you'll have to keep track of a lot of abilities, numbers and synergies. For me, this aspect was made surprisingly harder by the fact that units have health to the left and attack to the right, unlike what I'm used to.

But despite the limited number of heroes and abilities, the game remains surprisingly complex. There are many possible strategies and synergies, you'll need to constantly juggle your party around, and the three tribes play sufficiently differently. If you lose your main randomly-generated hero, you lose. If a companion dies, they merely become injured for the next fight. But figths in the second half of the game can easily become unwinnable if you lose too much firepower, and sneaky things like an unlucky Aimless strike or a Counterattack can end your run. Thanksfully, they aren't long.

It's a good game. The variety is a bit limited, but battles become complicated due to positioning and multiple synergies. And, again, it's hard.

As for the cute presentation, it's absolutely lovely.

There have been some complaints about the difficulty and balancing of this game, causing people to downvote it, but after winning a run after only 4 hours of play time, I can confidently say that it is not more difficult than any other game in the genre, and I honestly don't know why so many people reacted the way they did. 

Deckbuilder roguelites are intended to be challenging, and this one does a great job of keeping things fresh with new and interesting mechanics that really make you think about dynamic positioning of your units and whether or not they should even be on the field at all (you can recall units to heal them and avoid attacks, then replay them later).

What really drew me to this game is the beautiful art style and music. This game is extremely charming and doesn't deserve to be left at the bottom of the steam bargain bin because it's 'unbalanced'.

Edit: I still wholeheartedly recommend this game after 40 hours of play time and getting all the achievements :)","0.523809552192687988","1681907826","true","227","6240","0","10","0","1","0","0"

The art as well as the mechanics are excellent. The ability to swap cards around lanes for free and the fact that enemies attack first makes the turn-to-turn gameplay much more engaging than most in the genre. I think the difficulty 'problem' of this game is overblown. It is hard, but not harder than say, FTL or Spelunky. But no game is perfect, and what is holding this game back in my eyes is some lack of clarity, like the exact attack order (which is being added as a toggle by the devs), and some interactions not being obvious (like what constitutes a hit for card effects), which, once you learn them are consistent but will probably lose you a couple runs.

Hand-drawn animated art, ranges from adorable pets to creepy shadow monsters
Lovely music with perfect ambience for regular battles, boss battles, town
Cards can be enhanced with random modifiers (think Inscryption), giving you great variability
Damaged allies can be recalled during the fight to prevent injury in the next battle (compare to Legend of Keepers)
Enemy teams are set up to synergize with each other
The final boss is just as randomly ridiculous as your own team (no spoilers!)

Depends on what you like:
Unlocks are challenge-based (e.g. defeat enemies with Thorns, instead of just gain XP)
Far fewer battles compared to StS or similar, but each single encounter is far more strategically involved (brain shutoff click all cards almost never possible)
Far fewer upgrades between encounters, but each upgrade can drastically change your build
Random modifiers on enemies can directly counter your team setup
Runs are fairly short, maybe half an hour (no speedrunning)

Bad:
There's a bunch of different enemy teams, but I've seen the same ones repeatedly in the few hours
In harder difficulties, random modifiers on enemies can result in no counterplay options, forcing a restart. Balancing required, but the game is fairly new so this might still be adjusted

The daily challenge is extremely tough to beat, after 60 hours in the game I can't get a single win, the problem is that you can only attempt it once per day.

The UI is bad, so you cannot see when certain monsters will attack because their UI is covered by another larger nearby monster.

This leads you to have to play a bunch of boring unwinnable games, finally get a good run with good RNG, get excited, be about to have a great victory - then die instantly because of some unit you didn't see because it was covered up by another unit.

Again, the RNG is way too much. Slay The Spire is 1,000,000,000x better. 

Kind of had fun and cute game but really do not get any satisfaction out of this game.

edit: just want to add that I realize now the game is balanced around farming gold on the early minions by chaining combos. If you farm enough gold that way you can overcome bad RNG by buying a ton of stuff at shops. but, I stand by my negative review of how the game doesn't do a good job displaying information so you will make stupid mistakes that waste an hour of your time unless you slow your playing pace to a crawl to overanalyze everything.

It's also very unforgiving, and this, while not necessarily a bad thing, is a glaring flaw if you don't like your run to be made or broken by a single card decision. This genuinely feels like a fresh take on the deckbuilder genre. It's closest comparison is Monster Train, both in difficulty and in playstyle, but I think this game fixes some flaws in monster train while at the same time having new shortcomings. There's enough new mechanics and the game is so simple on the surface that it gives a very newcomer friendly vibe.

The artstyle is neat, the game is very smooth, the mechanics are very easy to understand. I like the town progression system, it gives a Darkest Dungeon vibe without being as complicated. The cards are very simple, but adding in everything together makes the game nicely complex and navigating a successful final boss fight is super rewarding.

The biggest problem with Wildfrost is how unforgiving it is. There is no room for error, especially once you start adding in the modifier bells (this games version of 'Ascension' like in Slay the Spire). It can be incredibly frustrating to make a small mistake and suddenly your leader gets killed and your entire run is in the garbage. To reiterate, because of how unforgiving the game is, you have to have an eagle eye on your character's positioning, the enemies' turn counters, how the various status effects come in to play, and if you miss even one of these small details it can mean your run is over and you're back in the town. Personally, I think a life counter (something like, your leader can die 2 or 3 times during a run) can easily curb this problem. Perhaps you can find a soul crystal to give your leader a second life in one of the events or in the shop.

Overall, the game is good, but the difficulty can feel unfair at times. I would say, if you compare it to StS, that game is consistently fun even when you lose, whereas Wildfrost feels awful when you lose sometimes, but when you pop off it's probably the most fun deckbuilder there is.","0.598875224590301514","1685477443","true","1604","6380","0","10","283","10","0","0"

A new version of the final boss that is so laughably overpowered that I'm not even gonna try to fight it. Ever.

That's Wildfrost in a nutshell. Lose an ally but complete a fight? They're injured now, meaning you might as well have died yourself, because you're impossibly behind the curve now. Treasure chest doesn't have anything that adds value or synergy to your deck? Too bad. They force you to take a card anyway, lowering the overall effectiveness of your deck. Bosses ask so much of you and require such radically different strategies that you have to build decks around them. Except you can't, because the nature of a roguelike is that you'll never have access to all your tools. It never gets easier. You never get extrinsically stronger. You are never allowed to feel like you've achieved something, or that the pressure is finally letting up because of your efforts. And even if you beat them, you're still coming out the other end worse off because it means you have to play more of this game.

Wildfrost: even when you win, you lose.","0.48673132061958313","1685470071","false","387","387","0","10","757","4","0","0"

I start by making that statement as loud and clear as possible because a majority of the negative reviews whinge about how hard this game is. 

[h2]It is supposed to be hard on your first go[/h2]

Death is part of the experience. Don't expect to even remotely win your first game let alone your first boss. Learn the mechanics, familiarize yourself with the meaning of each area, learn from your failures. Which each passing game you unlock things and get progressively stronger. That is the point of a Roguelite.

I consider myself a veteran in rougelite/like deckbuilding games and on my first blind run i only managed to scrape by the first boss and basically lost at the second boss due to me not expecting his mechanics, which is a key point. This game has huge emphasis on card effects. Like HUGE emphasis. Pretty much every enemy has a gimmick that you need to understand to be able to counter and this is knowledge you will gain from experiencing the game over time.

Also to point out when i say veteran it doesn't mean i only play a lot of StS or Monster Train, I've played countless of various rougelike deckbuilders so im familiar with how extremely different the play styles/planning will be, which leads me to the next point...

[h2]Mechanics differing from famous Deckbuilding Roguelikes is not a Con[/h2]

Another silly complaint that creeps up is how your hero is randomized and this causes it harder to plan for the future. [i]The whole concept of a roguelike game is making the best with what you got[/i]. It just happens that for this game, mechanically speaking, they want you to also work around that randomization of heroes.

[list]
[*]Hero with multi attack? Consider giving damage buffs or status application per hit.
[*]Hero with damage scaling on kill? Consider taking speed items and temp buffs so they can get kills and snowball
[*]Hero with high health? Consider buffing their tankiness whilst companions DPS and getting cards that apply status on getting hit
[/list]

The comparison to StS or Monster Train's specific hero and cardset is not really a valid argument. It's a different game with differing mechanics. It's like saying a Lemon is a bad fruit because it isn't sweet like an Apple on the basis that they are both fruits. If you want a game where the main hero is always constant, then go play something else instead of leaving a bad review on a good game because it doesn't suit your taste lol.

Play with the cards you are dealt with not whinge about how you can't get what you want.

[h2]Now with that out of the way, what do i think about the game?[/h2]

The deckbuilding roguelike aspect is honestly very fun. Runs feel varied enough (Randomized hero/companions) whilst also having enough constants (Expected monster types) to make it mostly fine for you to plan for what's coming. Whilst the path options are fairly limited there is still enough randomness that would force you to think more.

Where the game truly takes a harsher turn is in the actual combat. Each turn you play a card needs to be thoroughly thought out and executed as you can potentially change a game winning run to a straight up hopeless run with the wrong cards/actions being played. Pair that with many different types of card effects and combination make a lot of flashy (but expected) combos from the enemy.

Also did i forgot to mention the aesthetics? It is damn beautiful. I'm technically gameplay > graphics in general but honestly the art style and theme in this game is really well done and extremely pretty to look at. The UI effects and music are also top notch and very well done.

[h3]As a final note, for people that are still somehow struggling in this game, here are some tips i've noticed that can help progress in early game:[/h3]

[list]
[*]READ READ READ!!! Understand the card effects of both yours and the enemies!
[*] Move your units around. It's free and usually you can move your units to either mitigate damage/sacrifice, prioritize damage on a single unit or just avoid effects overall.
[*]Try and predict your next few moves/retaliation. The only unknowns appear from 2 scenarios: 1) Drawing new set of cards and 2) New enemies appearing in field
[*]Keep an eye on the wave counter. Expect when the next wave arrives and prepare accordingly
[*]Prioritize bursting enemies if you can. Enemies overwhelming you with numbers is a very common loss scenario.
[*]Deploy companions ASAP. You want the ticking timer on their moves to come down ASAP. Playing direct effect cards may be nice but you lose out on both having someone to back you up + free actions when the counters tick down.
[*] Don't sweat companion's death. Being injured is not as bad as it sounds and honestly sometimes its better to let a companion tank a 20 dmg hit with 1 hp (RIP Pootie!)
[*] Snoof is actually quite useful both as a meatshield and to stall an enemy turn.
[*] The snow stall mechanic is actually very powerful especially the 1 snowball stall on hit since it can be utilised on bosses
[*] Always buy the crown in the shop. What this trinket does is allow you to play the attached card in the start of battle for free. Certain cards (Like the one that deal 5 damage to undamaged enemies[edit:Apparently not so great considering enemies come in waves, unless you can wipe all but 1 enemy and use extra turns for cards go for companions instead]) are crazy good value and brings very strong synergy. Also bear in mind, a card play is a single turn, so that actually is a trinket for a free turn!

I play a lot of games in this genre, I wouldn't say I'm highly skilled but I enjoy a challenge and am very persistent. All to say, I don't mind that it's hard. But I do mind so much randomness and a difficulty building up a proper strategy. 

I also think some things need to be explained better - I quit playing when I found a charm that I thought would make a card's attacks apply 2 weakness to the target, only to realize too late that it applied 2 weakness to the character I equipped it to. 

I would buy this again at a deeper discount, or pay full price if I read reviews and see there's been some tweaks to make it more balanced. I think it's got very cool art, I love the icy setting, and I appreciate the fresh take on the genre. If I had more money, I would probably just keep it and tinker with it for a while, but as I'm very strapped for cash, I have to be super picky about what I keep.

When I saw RTGame play this game I knew I had to pick it up and give it a try. The reviews were sorta off putting since most of them were saying it was ball busting or a straight downgrade from Slay the Spire (a game I plan on playing very soon), but for $20 I said why not and bought it. Let me tell you: I'm glad I did.

The game starts out hard since in classic roguelike fashion you don't know what anything does yet, but an added extra difficulty is in play with the timer system. People (ally and enemy alike) don't attack until a little timer below them reaches zero, this forces you to need to think ahead a couple steps when making your moves. Combine this with the fact that two rows exist and you can freely move your companions between those rows, and you got a lot of components to think of in battle. 

I found this very fun and although it is fairly unforgiving, majority of my deaths I felt were due to poor choices on my part rather than RNG straight screwing me (I'm looking at you aimless). Combine this with a very cute and colorful art style with a simplistic story (which is all you really need) and I'd say the game is a solid 8/10 for $20. Now I 100%'d the game in 46 hours, but I didn't explore all the possible build varieties (I'd still like to get a teeth and/or overheat build going) so I'd say its a game someone could easily get 50+ hours out of if they truly enjoyed it. 

Overall I think the game is great for $20 and definitely worth a purchase if you want a fun little challenging game.","0.575465738773345947","1685201184","true","2816","3751","0","28","267","4","0","0"

On the plus side, it's super cute and fun, with a lot of content for such a cheap game. It's different every time and there are lots of fun builds to run. On the minus side, it's balance is absolutely horrendous. You can very easily get fights that are straight up unwinnable due to rng, even if you took all of the best options for your deck. Getting the 3 winstreak achievement can be extremely frustrating when you have an amazing deck going and some tanky enemy spawns in with thorns that one shot your leader and you have to attack it. Honestly if they could tone down thorns and tweak one fight in particular (involving thorns and aimless), I would highly recommend this game.

Part of that I think comes down to the way it encourages you to rename each of the characters to make them feel just a little more like they are your own, and part of it comes down to the mechanics of how the tactical combat encourages you to be moving your heroes not only in the best position to fight the enemy, but also to keep one another safe.

The artstyle is absolutely adorable and even without a single line of dialogue each of the characters has so much personality. I found myself not only getting attached to characters for their in game benefits, but because I just liked their design and felt attached to them.

Also, without spoiling anything, this game does something incredibly smart and cool when you get to the end game that I am absolutely shocked it was the first Rogue Like I have played that did it. If you get there, you know what I am talking about.

If I had to give criticism to the game, I would say:

Only having 3 factions feels a little on the low side.

The Gnome faction in particular feels extremely feast or famine, either you have some build that absolutely breaks the game in half, or you are getting completely overwhelmed with poor card draw order.

The Crown item available in the shop is obscenely powerful, but the number of shops you get in a run is random, and that can be frustrating when you have a ton of money but nowhere to spend it, or run into a ton of shops without the money to buy the crown. You can do really well with a build that collects a ton of money, but if you don't get any shops you can't buy the best thing to buy with that money.

Lastly some of the card upgrades are incredibly niche useful. That in itself isn't too bad a thing, but because you can never choose what upgrade you get, it can feel like sometimes you were cheated out of an actually useful upgrade. I imagine they did this to pressure players into finding that niche use, and to the game's credit it is satisfying when you do find it, but if you don't have the cards that would benefit from it, it just feels like a waste.

But none of that changes the fact that Wildfrost might be my favorite deck building rogue like.","0","1685055401","true","5411","19580","0","39","0","0","0","0"

Maybe it's the fact that you can't just go back to the menu and restart the whole battle when you fuck up by not taking a detail into account, maybe it's that Aimless is a dogshit mechanic, maybe it's the weirdly corporate lookin art for most of the characters, maybe it's the pace of the game.
Really anti-adhd in the sense that you'll just suddenly die from missing the slightest thing instead of it and asking the game to go fuck itself for it instead of it being a gradual pile of little mistakes being the result of your loss.
The only high point is when you get lucky with the charm gacha after gaming well enough to get a bunch of combos and fat stacks resulting from it.
Tried playing it for as much as possible and won once, and I'm kind of the opposite of hooked, kind of wish I had bought it day 1 so it would at least have been half priced.
Also the game fuckin broke on the 2nd day of me trying to launch it and wanted me to redownload it.

It's a bit of a deep cut, but it feels a lot more like Slice&Dice to me. Especially in the way that each turn is a of puzzles where you start totally dead and buried and have to dig your way out of the problem. The genius is that there's almost always a way to do it, so it *feels* hard and makes you feel really smart for figuring it out.

The game punishes mistakes HARD, losing 1 minion because of a missplay can mean the difference between winning or losing that battle and unlike slay the spire or monster train you can't exit the fight and reenter to restart the encounter, it saves where you got.

But there are many fun strategies and from the start with your leader and companion you can already plan a certain one.

I think it's lots of fun and i hope to see DLC for this game. Although adding cards is dangerous because it can clog the card pool therefore making certain cards less likely to appear, i would def like to see:

- more clans
- more unlocks

The game isn't unbalanced as people make out. It has a wonderful art style and charm, as well as a great take on the roguelike genre, but slightly let down by the lack general of content; would greatly benefit from mod support and further updates/dlc.

Having played the demo last year I was champing at the bit to get this game up and running, however when I got to the purchase screen on release the game had garnered quite the negative response with many players claiming the game is 'too hard' or 'unbalanced'.

Having played for roughly 20 hours I have finally got round to beating my first play through, and have experienced many eureka moments that have opened my eyes to how the game really should be approached. And let's be honest, most roguelikes are not completed quicker than this, the people claiming they have a stupid number of hours on games like slay the spire forget how difficult the game was when you first start, yes you can likely scrap your way through it now if you started a new game with no save, but that could be said for Wildfrost too now that I have knowledge and experience in the game.

On the surface, this game feels extremely unfair and imbalanced, but as you peel away the layers, become more accustomed with locations, cards, enemies, and bosses, the game becomes far more manageable and way less intimidating. It has an interesting learning curve, first you have to get your head around the basics, then you're thrown into the world and die over and over again to what feels like 'BS', but then the next learning curve comes along and you start to make more progress.

I have had a blast with this game, going from totally disregarding certain allies, to winning a round with all of those. 

The art style and sound track is what first grabbed me, but the game itself is what has kept me coming back run after run. 

My biggest criticism with the game is not the difficulty, but what now feels like a lack of content. At this point I have unlocked nearly all content at the base, and it feels like there's no reason to look at any of the locations that have had a lot of time and effort spent on them. 

I'm surprised there are no active choices for the player to make outside of a run, no way to choose to unlock specific cards in a shop, and some shops feel so underwhelming with how much is actually unlocked. The pet shop for example, has what feels like a tiny number of pets to get, adding far more unlockables in these area feels like such an easy way to boost the content of the game and give players more to strive towards and make the town feel more worthwhile going back to. 

We need more content in the form of more updates or dlc. also mods, we need mods for this game.","0","1684921887","true","1182","1339","0","3","0","0","0","1"

With that in mind, I think Wildfrost could very well be one of the greats - but maybe it needs some slight balance adjustments.

Turn-counter + hero/ally system adds some interesting dynamics to the genre and the game is quite challenging at first. Once one becomes familiar with the game mechanics, the game becomes beatable and is not as difficult as many other ratings claim it is. 

I wish that some of the charms could be placed on units despite the 'drawbacks' not having an effect. For example, the Moose Charm increases attack by 3, but also increases turn counter by 1. The game will not allow you to place the Moose Charm on a unit that only has smackback, as the unit does not have a turn counter and thus cannot be increaesed by 1. It makes snese, but allowing the charm to be placed regardless would enable players to lean-into units that have natural 'drawbacks' and buff them without experiencing the debuff that would normally attach to any given charm. Just my 2 cents.","0.525547444820404053","1684772889","true","3038","4257","0","15","117","1","0","0"

P.S. Edit: After watching more videos of game play in addition to a few more games. Combat really should have more rewards than just money. I feel like the path to the last boss needs to be  more than a corridor that has 2 doors to reach the same place. 

Some runs just kill you because you aren't offered anything that synergies with your chosen leader. Also fully randomized leaders with a game so full of RNG? Also WAY too many bosses have 'immunity' to snowballs. The game needs more ways to punish snowball stun lock than 'snowballs' waste your turn. Why introduce a fun mechanic if it can only be used against you? Like more leader's that get or give buffs when something is snowballed. Give use someway to customize our starting leader besides just which cute pet you take. Starting leaders need more control over how they play. Nothing is more worse than finding 2 leaders are aimless with terrible stats and the other is backshot with only health.

The main complaint of negetive reviews is that this game is not balanced, I'm sorry but that is just copium, if you think the game is poorly balanced you are just bad at the game, which is ok but you should own up to it.

The game is difficult yes, but it is in no way 'unbalanced', of course you can't get everything to be perfectly balanced, but, through companions, pets, items, charms, events, enemies, almost nothing is 'too weak' or 'too strong' (besides the teeth + aimless starting enemies, and maybe the Razor (wild, frenzy) boss.

In game, I have 16 hours of gameplay with 9 wins, or 29% win rate, I believe most of my losses, and other player's losses, are becasuse we don't look at the enemy's board, and so we get punished, that is fair. I don't think only because we don't take 10 extra seconds to view the board, that the game is 'unbalanced', and that they should nerf enemies because we make mistakes.

some fights counter certain builds, are some fights much harder (in general) than they should be? Yes,  but it's almost never unwinnable, we just need to not be lazy and analyze the board a bit more to make sure everything is in place.


Now to what I didn't like, the unlocking new cards system. The system works in such a way that you only have 1 avaliable task open from each building, and if you complete the task you unlock a new item/companion/pet.

The problem with this is that sometimes I feel like I'm being force to choose, instead of the cool option, I have to choose something else for a task: things like choosing different starting tribe than I would like to, choose companions I don't want, or go to a path I don't want to because I know there is a chance I will get somethings that will help that spesific task, and that is not fun.

Some pet spoiler alert.
I had a Tusk teeth run, after finishing it I unlocked Sneeizle, since his unlocking task doesn't require specific build, After unlocking him, my next tusk to unlock a new pet was using teeth to kill 10 enemies, seeing that took the winds out of my sail, the entire point of Wildfrost is to try and experiment with different builds, so forcing myself to redo that build was very annoying, adding to that is the fact that you can only get teeth kills with 1 card, that's Tusk, there is no other card in the game that adds teeth (besides Taiga, but she must be the worst companion in the game), so until I found Tusk again, took me a long time.
Also after getting 10 kills with teeth, I unlocked a teeth based pet, like what the hell, do you want me to do another teeth build????
that specific pet is probably the worst one, both in game and poorly designed concidering what pets are suppost to do but I wont get into that.

I think the game would benefit if the tasks you had to do where more general and not specific to certain builds, here is a good task in the game: add 10 wood hp to wooden cards, not only there are 2 tribes that already start with wooded cards, but there are also items and charm that add wood hp.

Pet spoiler alert. 
Another way to do it is give players to tools to complete a task in the stage before, for example: give me the teeth pet before I do the 10 kills enemies with teeth task, so I can start with it and use it to complete the task.

Another way is allow the players to comeplete up to 2 tasks ahead, so we don't get stuck for 20 runs on the same task just because it requires a very specific build.

I know I complained a lot but that part is a small section of the entire game, the game is obvoiusly great, but there is no need to write about it since nobody complained about the gameplay.

No.  It's next best for the hardcore seeking a challenge or arguably God tier for anyone craving immediate challenge (very little difficulty ramp here relatively, even to Slay the Spire) who can tolerate the mind-fuckingly bad sloppy-UI-related campaign-ending-punishment of accidental misplays with no recourse.  If you're scrappy and not insanely skilled and you're really intrigued, you still might have a lot of fun.  The card file is good though the pacing takes getting used to.  Honestly it's refreshing when these games invite you to rethink action economies and pacing rather than just copy pasting what's come before.

Monster Train's difficulty curve is too shallow--StS gets it just right--and relatively this game has a steep curve.  You have to clear the game several times with mild and then major difficulty scaling to 'entirely complete it' (without further spoilers) and even an extremely skilled card player might not clear the basic run on the first run or two.

As many have said--it eschews a lot of card/deck for tactical/strategy/placement.  

In a nutshell:
-The visuals are great if you like the style
-The audio is decent
-The UI/UX is generally workable EXCEPT it's the worst I've ever experienced due to stakes of their mistakes.  There is no highlighted pre-signaling for some core combat stuff, no icon for stuff like 'smackback' and it has the worst rate of 'I accidentally campaign-wiped because their UI is shit' of any game I've played.  By far the biggest problem with the game.  Devs for the love of God.  Outside of the design question of whether you actually need both Spikes and Smackback, consider using consistent UI much?  

If you hated the slow difficulty ramp of Monster Train because you're a total master and you also love Dark Souls, this is what you've been waiting for.  If you're scrappy and intrigued and can handle some pain, ok.  Overall, least accessible deck-builder that's any good, but the harsh difficulty is rewarding for core fans who want a challenge or those who are simply very drawn to the genre in general.  Even when you've got it figured out, it's constantly tense yet still rewarding if you're actually working for that full complete (can come quick if you're apt).  You never 'transcend the game and it's difficulty' in this game the way you do in most deckbuilders.  Tons to optimize and learn, but it's rarely not tense.

Peak turn-based combat that incorporates creativity/deckbuilding from many perspectives.  I actually think it hits a pretty good sweet spot for a Rogue-Lite, usually if you play truly perfectly you should win, but RNG is definitely still a factor.  To be clear I think many bitter players overrate how RNG-based Roguelikes are in general ;p.","0.495275586843490601","1684631896","true","1507","6383","0","6","515","0","0","0"

With respect to the difficulty: I don't think the game is too hard or too punishing...but I think that it IS punishing in ways that are completely unnecessary. The game's mechanics combine in complex ways, and watching my leader die for a deterministic reason (either because I wasn't paying enough attention, or because some mechanics don't interact clearly) is frustrating in a way that is not fun. Yes, eventually I got better and beat the Heart of the Storm, but it didn't have to be so painful.

It feels like steps could be taken to resolve this issue. Certain cards like Monch need a change; there's no reason he should kill your Leader - especially when enemy cards that eat allies never eat a Boss. It's nice that I can recall allies, but it feels wrong that I can't skip my Leader's attack if it would result in a loss. In general, some kind of indication that you're about to kill yourself would help - similar to how you can't mate yourself by accident in chess. 

At the end of the day, I realize why the game works like it does - it makes for a very clean experience, and I'm impressed enough by the game overall that I can deal with its rough edges.","0.495275586843490601","1684618448","true","1542","1748","0","1","187","0","0","0"

Really not sure where the 'too hard' complaints that had this game at 'mixed reviews' came from back then. Pretty much every run can make it to the final boss, barring silly mistakes or unlucky timing.

The deck building aspect takes a bit of a back seat, imo. Limited opportunities to truly craft your own unique deck and more of making your starting deck bulky and hoping you draw your combo pieces. And there are a limited amount of scripted battles, so the journey is basically always the same.

Overall, a fun and well made game with nice artwork. Hoping the upcoming big update adds a lot of content, as it stands I think the replay-ability is very limited once you complete the game.","0.519999980926513672","1684616080","true","2553","28059","30","23","368","2","0","0"

It has all the readability issues that various other games in the genre have partially or wholly done away with on their own, but combined into one game. This makes it initially feel like total crap to try and parse and get used to.
However, get past that and the feeling the counter-system gives you in control is pretty unmatched.

All in all the game is quite fun can use some balance, it took me about 6 hourish to finish it I think, but I think its mostly hard if you go for builds that are hard to pull off like Sacrifice and Summon build. I feel like if you can get Noomlins its playable... (Maybe add a 1\1 summon with noomlin so you can combo sacrifice more easily 0-0)

- game is extremely hard due to the lack of information given and wording in cards and abilities ( no explanation till you use them. This forces experimentation and failing consistently which can be frustrating, 
-in this game 1-2 mistake can ruin you're whole run plus with random heroes( perks) this makes making another run to learn a specific archetype super inconsistent
-[spoiler]has bugs in the game in term of final boss items ( example STS keys ) not appearing  which can ruin runs streaks [/spoiler]
- [spoiler]is not made for infinite decks like STS as  the game will crash consistently[/spoiler]
- As a player that has ascension 20( all character) and finish all of STS content this game after end game feels bad too play.  The replay ability is high but the archetype are too limited in most runs due to rng making a a pivot later on most time impossible if you don't wanna throw the whole run ( example going claw deck mid way in game ) 
- very little content after 10-20 runs  you basically seen everything (hoping any dlc will drop)  
-[spoiler]unlocks feels useless due to randomness of game making some item, trinkets, heroes never appear even after unlocks or do not fit you're archetype[/spoiler]
- [spoiler]extra game play( item ,trinkets, heroes) is lock behind challenges which makes some runs only done for unlocks which is i think is bad game design for a game mostly randomizer for everything[/spoiler]

summary:  the game is great would recommend for anyone burned out on card rouge lite, expect a hard game due to lack of information from the game. game play is fun but some game design choices are quite frustrating due to heavy RNG system in items and heroes ( RNG does not equal fun), high skill ceiling game early.","0","1684503163","true","3170","39756","0","3","0","0","0","0"

Pros : 
- Really nice art style ( That was my first impression when I decided to buy it )
- Music is okay not bad and not good but its not make me feel boring
- Replaying value now is good but not best
- The gameplay is quite impressive for me because not only have to decide to choose the right cards but also arrange the Companions accordingly.
Cons :
- This is new game so the number of cards and companions is limited
- Too few paths to choose from
- Still have small bug with me

- Enemy stats are jacked into the high heavens
- You're not given enough options/opportunity to make a powerful deck
- Oh what's that you actually managed to make a strong deck? Woops, randomly hard countered
- Some charms are just a slap in the face because it's useful for like 1% of decks
- Aimless mobs (hits at random) are way too plentiful and have not enough to counter them because it's often unreasonable to kill stuff before it attacks. Some hit so hard or have such detrimental effects that you can't make an entire row get away with getting hit, making the entire mechanic a pure coinflip so often
- Unlocks are locked behind way too many different and convoluted actions

And all of this is made all the worse by the game just being unforgiving to any and all mistakes. There's no preview, no undo, no reset. You better be damn sure about the outcome of the turn, because one mistake can easily turn into a game over. While that is more under the category of a skill issue, it makes this unfair game all the more frustrating.","0.510039925575256348","1684467374","false","310","310","0","1","0","12","1","0"

So I thought I'd take a different approach.  While the game is objectively tough to start out with, the more you play, as you do with most games, you'll figure out the different nuances required to have a successful run.  

The most important aspect that I found was, TAKE YOUR TIME.  There is no hurry to continue on to your next turn: right click enemies to learn what their keywords do, pay attention to who's attacking on each side and figure out the order in which the next turn plays out (remember baddies go first and proceeds top to bottom left to right), and do some maths.  As long as your characters do not reach 0 health, they'll return next fight fully healed.  You can gauge your cards will take/tank, and rearrange your cards to make that happen.

Secondly, don't fixate on killing every minion... if the boss is out and you kill it, the rest will run away.  

Last bit of parting advice, there are three different factions in the game.  Once you've unlocked them all, try each one out and see which one plays more towards your play style and then stick with it.  The more you get used to them, the easier you'll discover broken combos that make the game a breeze.  

As with other rouge-light games even if you fail, you'll likely be unlocking new cards every run and your subsequent attempts will be easier for it.  Don't give up!","0","1684465065","true","802","1183","0","71","0","0","0","0"

It's a great game design lesson in how giving less options can somehow result in more interesting results. Instead of forcing there to be a variation on every effect in every theme like some games like to do, every mechanic and faction is unique yet the cards are tuned to be cohesive outside of their archetype occasionally. Runs don't feel samey even when running the same archetype and you never feel shoehorned into a specific archetype with the options you're given. Combat is a masterpiece of efficiency and well conveyed information to the player. 10/10 would obsess about again.","0.476190477609634399","1684456183","true","580","1499","0","4","0","0","0","0"

So i already knew some of the mechanics a new player might get tripped up by like 2nd phases for bosses and certain interactions.

That being said, i am incredibly confused by some of the negative reviews that have been posted. Seeing people say they keep losing to rng, when in my first 15 runs i have lost to rng maybe once( which was me losing a 1/27 roll to lose) and every other loss can be attributed to me making small mistakes or reviews that say they did 10 runs never getting past the first act boss with a whopping 70 mins of playtime which is insane. That means if they never went to town and played the whole time they were doing 7 min runs on average while mine were closer to 50mins-1hr.

Would I expect a new player to win on his first run? Of course not, just the bosses having 2nd phases is probably enough to kill your first run.

But once you have the knowledge necessary and you're willing to take your time on crucial turns I believe most people can be very successful at it.

People seem to be complaining a lot about this game's balance and just how challenging it was.  

I understand where those complaints are coming from, but I would never say it's worth a negative review. Yes the game is challenging, and what you get on card drafts does affect your chances more than I'd necessarily like, but it took about 15 runs to learn all the mechanics and finish one, which is nothing ridiculous for a rogue-like, after all that's the point a lot of people call themselves satisfied with the game and will stop playing it.","0","1684444925","true","373","2285","0","16","562","0","0","0"

The combat is wildly unbalanced. Typically your choices won't make any differences and you will quickly lose again and again. Its not a matter of difficulty, but RNG. Also, when you win, your party becomes the next boss, not a fan of that. I'm also getting tired of bad games designing around the refund window. The more I played this, the more I saw that there are very few combinations that actually work, and this game is a failure compared to the many successful card games before it. The best part of this game is uninstalling if after you win. Currently it seems like the vast majority will never experience this bliss.

By the way, only 10.3% have the achievement for defeating the heart of the storm. That is very telling if you possess critical thinking abilities.","0.518518567085266113","1681399654","false","414","1898","0","70","0","2","1","0"

Combine that with the art style of Gaziter and i'm all for it. Wildfrost is similar and yet not so similar to others in the genre. I've played hours of Slay the spire and things like Inscryption but I find this game has the highest difficulty curve out of all of them right out of the gate. It starts off simple and then takes a sharp turn upwards that will have you dying over and over for at least the first 10 hours.

You might start out  feeling frustrated but when you look back at your run and think why it failed it is mostly likely your own fault. Early on in the game I did not take enough time to consider the board and more often than not set in motion the snowball that ended in my loss.

In this deck builder the positioning of your units is paramount to being successful. If your leader falls in battle it is game over. Your leader cannot be taken off the board.  The game encourages you to reposition and withdraw units to heal them. If a unit dies in battle, it's stats are halved for the next battle that follows. This is why it is PARAMOUNT you carefully consider when to place, withdraw and heal units.
Units being damaged and halved in usefulness after dying in the previous battle encourages you to treat your units more carefully but on the other it can be very punishing if you let units die right in a normal fight right before the important Boss fight.

I've managed to fully beat the game with just one achievement to go and here is a summary of my pros and cons of this game.

Pros -
[list]
[*]Gorgeous art style and sense of design. Card frames, creature designs and animations are lovely. It is absolutely bright and charming with a lot of personality. The visuals are very well polished.

[*]Very quick to get into a game with no predetermined leader character. Your character at the start of your run is randomised so it is fun to play around with and you never know what you'll get.

[*]I'm personally a fan of what happens when you beat  a run, Spoilering for some folk; [spoiler] Fighting your previous team is a fantastic idea. I had the most fun creating an OP team only to have to make an even greater OP team designed to counter that OP team is fun and thrilling.[/spoiler] 

[*]Big focus on strategy over combos. You can have some amazing synergy between characters and cards. Once you get into the swing of it you'll realise that there's a lot to think about.

[*]Big fan of the soundtrack and absolutely adore the boss and battle themes. Some of the tracks start quiet until the first bit of damage is done in battle and then they really kick off.

[*]Once you are accustomed and well versed in the in s and outs of the game it can be a very challenging but satisfying experience. This is especially so once you are on the route to the true ending.
[/list]
Cons-
[list]
[*]Not enough player choices to have a good grip/control of your deck. Sometimes some runs it is impossible to force a strategy due to RNG and you must deal with what you are dealt. It feels like 3/4 of your deck is down entirely to RNG. The game could benefit from more player agency.

[*]Not being able to refuse a card at an event is strange. You are forced into a situation where you must take a card whether you want to or not. 

[*]Some of the balancing issues of this game vary. Some encounters are absolutely awful unless you have a good set up. After the first boss the difficulty spikes.

[*]Aimless is not a very fun status effect in a strategy game paired with teeth. It takes away the strategy element and leaves it down to RNG. You can counter this but It can be frustrating.

[*]It feels like some of the charms you unlock in the game are more of a hindrance than a boon. There are several I have never used. This is the same for a few cards that have very niche uses.

[/list]

Overall this is a lovely Indie rogue like card game and I do recommend it for lovers of the genre. Just don't go in expecting the same experience as Slay the Spire and give it time to grow and learn with it.

I often had runs where random events gave me low gold, poor artifacts, and cards and characters that didn't work well together. Then the game makes me face multiple enemies that deal medium to high damage and have very high health or armor. In those situations, it was simply impossible to win because I never had the items and cards I would have needed. Not only that, but unlocking new items and characters makes the problem worse since it further dilutes the card pool.

This is a balancing issue, and it happens too much, A simple solution would be to offer players more choices when looting cards or items, or opportunities to trade cards, so as to increase players' ability to build a proper deck.

The game has a lot of potential, but currently you either have a run that gives you a chance to win, or a run that won't let you win no matter what you do.","0.499374538660049438","1684345774","false","335","389","0","28","0","5","0","0"

It's basically hard to learn and very easy to master. 

There are so many different very easily achievable completely broken builds that allow you to beat even the true final boss in turn 0 that it becomes less about strategy and more about abusing game mechanics. The ink clan is especially guilty of this with the ability to play junk cards for free during turn 0. This isn't here to stay but even without it the game still offers plenty insanely strong builds that trivialize the game.

The art is obviously very good as others have said.

I personally wish the game sees some rebalancing, both to make it easier for beginners but also to make it harder for experienced players. I also hope it sees some nice content updates because the card pool is a little shallow right now, and so is the enemy diversity.","0.596796631813049316","1684235466","true","4436","7959","0","6","0","8","0","1"

I can't speak for Slay the Spire or Monster Train, which I see other reviews compare this game to often. I love strategy and tactical games, and that's really what this game is all about, wrapped up in an extremely charming and polished aesthetic. Wildfrost is a game that forces you to think out your strategies and tactics in advance. Wildfrost isn't a deckbuilder where you get to build your perfect deck. It's a game that forces you to adapt with what you get. Each faction has it's own starting deck, which you can change and supplement throughout the run, but the cards you get are mostly up to chance. You'll have to experiment and engage with all of it's systems and mechanics in order to succeed. If you box yourself in to one strategy, you'll find the game very frustrating when it doesn't give you the cards you want.

Wildfrost is hard, yes. But it isn't unreasonably difficult or insanely unbalanced, as some reviews may make it seem. I'm not a very hardcore gamer, or even that great at strategy games to begin with, and I still beat the final boss on my second ever attempt. Wildfrost is difficult because there's a lot of different systems to consider. When I lose a run, it's usually my own fault. Either I misplayed a card, I overlooked something critical, or I just plain didn't plan ahead well enough. That isn't to say the game is perfect. Balance could certainly use some adjustment in some areas. But I can't help but think that a lot of the negativity this game gets is from people who bought this game expecting it to be something completely different.

I can't recommend Wildfrost enough, but that's only if you understand what exactly you're buying. This is a tactical game where you need to consider every move you make using a limited deck. It has a wonderful art style with an equally charming soundtrack. It's a game where you're expected to experiment often. If that doesn't sound appealing to you, then Wildfrost isn't the game for you, and that's okay. But if what I described sounds like something you'd enjoy, give the game a shot, because for what it is, it's a wonderful experience and highly addicting.","0.523809552192687988","1684216662","true","942","3311","0","1","0","3","0","0"

It's also a breath of fresh air as it's less focusing on building the best combo deck and more on strategy, unit synergy, enemy match-ups, etc. Maybe that's why most of Steam reviewers calls it hard, because you have to think about a lot of things. But on other way, the game also feels less RNG-y and you have almost full control on how good the run is instead of depending on 'this build need this card, this relic, etc'.","0","1684209277","true","131","738","0","20","657","0","0","0"

Meaning a game isn't hard exactly, you just need to learn and improve. I can get behind that. This game is not one of those games.

I don't see that here. I see some cool ideas held back by mechanics that relay a bit too much on RNG. Over the roughly 10 runs I did, I only beat the first zone boss because of luck. The fights work in rows, making you attack the front enemy of the row. It summoned an enemy that attacked each time a card is played, increase its Attack by +1 permanently each time a card is played, in the back row. Didn't have the RNG to get a hero card that attacks the back line? Oh well, that enemy is swinging each card played and getting buffed each time. It has 8 health, so it takes multiple item cards (the best one does 2 damage) to kill it, with each play making it stronger. Plus I learned the hard way you can only have 4 characters on the field at a time. Synergies get very limited there.

This is one of those that would be really cool and really fun as it does spice things up if it wasn't held back by some heavily limiting RNG and core mechanics.","0.455599099397659302","1684195773","false","79","79","0","31","0","2","5","0"

Nice artistic style, music and UI but lacking in depth and execution. 

Very few deck build are feasible unless incredibly lucky, and meta progression doesn't really give much incentive to improve as the rewards are marginal (not even necessarily better). Also I'm stuck with a final boss which was my defensive teeth build that is nearly impossible to beat and no way to change who you face as until defeated. I saw this recommendation from other rogue-likes or deck-builder games hoping this might be give the same feel and complex decisions, but ultimately feels very lacking. It's often also very unclear the order of actions/reactions as they aren't all explained in the tutorial or a handy wiki how many of the mechanics work with each other.

I recommend checking out a lot of gameplay footage (of random games not just the wins) to get a sense of the game before purchasing, some will like it but it wasn't for me.","0.501423120498657227","1684161597","false","462","507","0","6","0","2","0","0"

   While the game is very simple to understand, it combines many simple mechanics into a turn based symphony of action management and card synergy. In other words, it's depth comes from the sheer amount going on at any given time. With each card you add to your deck, the complexity of both your enemies and your own deck seem to amp up. One of my only gripes I have is that I would love to see more tribes added to the game. The game has 3 very different tribes you can center your deck around, all having different companions and cards you can obtain throughout a run. While all 3 tribes are very fun, it leaves me wanting more and I hope DLC can add more of that variety. That said, the game has all the replayability you'd expect out of a roguelike, and I hope to put in more time with it to give it the playtime I think it deserves. 

This game is a must buy for anyone who enjoys this genre of deck building in the same vein as Slay the Spire.","0","1684107066","true","2339","2682","0","23","218","0","0","0"

As a roguelike each run lasts a perfect amount of time (between 15 minutes and 45 minutes). There's enough mechanical depth and variety to lose yourself in creating that completely broken deck you always wanted. It can be a little difficult at times because there's so much to keep track of. So it can be a bit of a feedback black hole.

But overall I think it's definitely worth your time. The presentation is delightful, the sound design and soundtrack is great. Lots to love!

However, I initially bought the game on Switch and later purchased on PC. I currently have over 40 hours in the game total. 

You've likely combed the reviews with the negative ones saying it's to hard, unfair, or unbalanced. Many positive reviews say that people are wrong and the game is beatable. I'm not going to re-hash those arguments. Wildfrost is very difficult, and sometimes it may seem a bit unfair. Even so, I don't wish for it to be easier. I enjoy it's difficulty level. If you like harder games that provide a challenge, I highly recommend this game. I do understand both sides, but I personally love the game which is why I recommend it.

Now onto the rest of my review:

Wildfrost is a deck builder. However, it isn't like traditional deck builders like Slay the Spire or Across the Obelisk. I can't compare to Monster Train because I haven't played it. This game relies heavily on card positioning. As a player, you must be constantly re-evaluating the placement of your cards. You need to re-position them to get the upper hand in the fights. This mechanic might not be for everyone. Beyond picking the right cards, it is probably the most important gameplay mechanic. 

As far as the music goes in Wildfrost, I absolutely love it. I really like the fact that the music starts low, quiet, sometimes hardly playing at all until the point something is attacked. Once the fight officially gets started, the music ramps up. I love that little piece about it. It makes you feel more engaged with the battle. 

The art style is amazing in my opinion. I think one of the core reasons I love this game is because of it's art style. It's clean, cute, and the designs are so creative. I love the artist's work in this game. Gaziter did such a great job. I also like the small nuances in the weapons for certain characters as they get stronger. For example, Yuki's snowball increases in size the stronger they get. It is another aspect of the game that makes it more engaging. 

Lastly, the thorn battle and haze are the absolute worst and are run killers. That being said, those fights are very beatable and they just annoy me sometimes. It doesn't stop me from loving this game. One other complaint is there are a couple of cards I avoid. They can have negative traits and if they target your leader it can end your run so be wary of that. I do hope that for those cards they at least consider changing how they target the leader.

If you are curious about the Switch, for any reason, the performance is good. There are a couple of bugs in the Switch version that I encountered. However, I believe the devs are going to address that. They are not game breaking bugs but just slightly annoying. Your cursor placement doesn't always start in the right spot when on the map view, and when you start a battle, you are sometimes hovering over the enemy cards as opposed to your leader. 

If you choose to pick up Wildfrost I hope you enjoy it. Definitely read other reviews to see if this is a game you might enjoy. I personally love it.","0.56428450345993042","1684076050","true","219","1323","0","14","0","3","0","0"

Basically, this game is quite hard to learn and get accustomed to, but when you do and you get used to everything it feels really awesome to just win so much. Between the different builds, the different factions, and the random captains, there are a lot of different builds to go out and try. Although some are definitely better than others, all of them can work in scenarios and it's mainly about making sure your build has a good balance for all the encounters.

I love how playing cards works in this game, playing one card each turn instead of having a mana cost per card, it makes for a very different experience.

The later fights ramp up to a difficulty that they are also pointless (can't win).  There is no skip function when offered a unit so you usually end up adding a unit that doesn't fit your build.  The game comes with a 'difficult' tag but at least part of the reason the game is difficult is because of the terrible options that can't be skipped.  I've been offered a charm that gives one of your units -2 attack countless times and I've yet to encounter a unit that would be better served by losing more of their already low attack.

However its let down by the card design, most 'heroes' are the same few ideas copy-pasted, most cards are quite generic, and a lot of the innovative design space is in service to an uninteresting gameplay loop and cookie-cutter strategies, the lack of customization at the start of each run can also get a bit samey. I'd love to be able to run very different strategies, but all the current strategies feel like variations on the same thing; make allies hit things.

But even with these complaints I think this game is really interesting and worth playing, and all of my complaints could be solved with a little more diverse content.

It's a very compact game, with a tight focus on a lean deck, a handful of creatures/companions to manage, and a full run clocking in somewhere around the 30+ minute mark. However, despite it's streamlining, there's still enough moving parts involved to give it some good, unique depth; a two lane battlefield on which you can reposition or recall your monsters at will, a unique draw system that allows you to mulligan mid-match at the cost of a turn, and a temporary injury mechanic which leaves you hesitant to use your companion cards as cannon fodder, all work in tandem to keep the briskly paced fights feeling tactically involved.

Speaking as a player that's fairly experienced with these sorts of games, I think it's fair to say that Wildfrost is a challenging game, but by no means would I say it's too difficult, or poorly balanced, as some others seem to think. I've certainly had a few runs where it just felt like my deck just wasn't coming together well, and even one or two mistakes on some of the harder encounters can bring the run to a sudden end. But overall, I've felt there are generally plenty of viable strategies and strong card synergies to choose from, and the game's quick pace means that even a dramatic, mortal blunder, right in the home stretch doesn't bring the same sort of gut-wrenching, defeated frustration that I've experienced with many other deckbuilders.

TLDR: Quick, engaging, and decently challenging. The most fun I've had since Monster Train, and a good choice for roguelike fans looking for something either a little different, or wanting a little less of a time commitment.

There's too much luck before hard battles. Like, I get that the boss battles should have a >50% chance of killing even a good run, but you need a few more non-boss battles inbetween to allow a satisfying amount of customization of deck before the restart.
 Also, there's a variety of things which seem a bit unbalanced. Maybe you have player statistics you can check to balance the various items and classes better?
I really liked the suggestion I saw in another review that would allow you to select your 'tribe'/class first, then get a selection of three heros of that tribe to choose from. That would be another way to give more room for player-choice.
Also, you really need to fix the fact that the helpful beginner tips keep popping up even after many times playing, that's annoying. Add an option to disable tips in the settings at least.","0.497925281524658203","1683853292","true","436","3226","0","10","0","0","0","0"

That all being said, one idea that this game should have taken from Slay the Spire was the long ascension mechanic so that the player can enjoy some wins at easier difficulties as they progress towards the true difficulty. Having played the game enough to get good at it, and just wrapped up the last of the achievements, I can confidently say that the difficulty is fair, but the journey to get there involved countless frustrating losses.

I feel this is a case where 'readability' is being mistaken for 'difficulty'. Let me explain.

First off Wildfrost is a challenging game, there is no denying that. Every turn there is a lot to keep track of, and forgetting that an enemy has 'Barrage' will lead to a quick and sudden defeat right when you thought you were safe and already thinking about the next turn. And the randomness of what you may get each run can lead to your deck being stronger or weaker than other runs. That last point itself is pretty standard for most roguelikes and roguelike deckbuilders in particular, but this is where I see many reviewers pointing to when it comes to why they think the game is un-fun. My experience with this aspect has been pretty on par with other games of the genre so I would have to disagree with that point. What I do find being more of an issue when compared to similar games like Slay the Spire is what I mentioned in my example about forgetting enemies have barrage and dying in a way that makes me feel like a dummy. 

Now look, I make these errors often in games where I get 'into the flow of the game' and just make plays without reading every detail before making every move. But I found this happening way more often in Wildfrost than most other games. That leads me to what i think the biggest issue WIldfrost has at the moment and why many players feel like it is 'too difficult'. Because it IS way to difficult................ to read what the heck is going to happen every turn.

Most turn-based games go out of their way to make sure the player doesn't miss the important details. Is a character gong to die at the end of your turn if you don't address it? Well that character is probably flashing RED as an indicator of that. Not in Wildfrost. Is a character going to do an AoE attack that will hit multiple units? Well you probably see RED flashing targets covering the area or the characters that will be hit. Not in Wildfrost...... except it is!!!....... one time. So yeah a boss in the game does in fact telegraph the areas it will be attacking with RED targets on the ground surrounding the effected spaces. So yes it can be done! And it is a good thing!

I understand that all of this is not an issue if you are very meticulous every single turn and make sure to re-read every character card after every single play, but that is an added mental load that just doesn't need to exist. Losing your run this way on occasion is funny because I know it was entirely my fault that i made a goof, but in WIldfrost it will happen often enough that it is becomes more frustrating over time. Bear in mind that with potentially 12 cards on the field, each with its own attack, health, timer, and keywords you can have upwards of 30 separate numbers and keywords at a time. Now I say this and it may sound like I think having so much going on is a bad thing, but it is not! All of those stats and effects add to the depth of the game and makes it really fun to play and replay. The real problem is that the game could do a much better job at communicating what everything does and provide players better indicators of what will happen from turn to turn. This wont make the game 'easier' in the sense that it would make your decisions less meaningful throughout the game, it would simply make it easier to process so that you can actually get to making those fun and interesting decisions.

I REALLY like this game but completely understand the frustrations that players have with it as well. I just hope that the right changes are made to better make the game more clear and concise instead of just making it less of a challenge. I don't think simply turning down the difficulty and balancing the numbers would actually solve the problems players are facing.

A final note and suggestion, some players apparently didn't even know that you can move companions around the board after being placed on it.

Balancing needs work. You are really limited in what you can use because some things are completely useless or hard countered by certain fights and you need to play perfectly and/or get lucky with what you are given to make it far. Its way too easy to get in a situation you cant beat or make 1 accidental mistake and then lose the whole run because of it. Its very difficult to recover from a mistake and if you do then you have 'Injured' cards which make the next battle even more difficult and more likely to lose. 

I think this has the potential to be the best Roguelike Deckbuilder if the balance is worked out (and more content is added). One suggestion I can make is to make Recalling your units into something like putting them on a bench temporarly, maybe for like 3 turns. Instead of putting it up to chance when you will see them again and losing a bunch of tempo you can just pull them back out when they are healed up. This will make it so its actually useful and reliable.","0","1683102432","false","1165","3207","0","32","0","0","0","0"

This game is a miserable exercise in tediously triple checking every last detail, turn after turn, to make sure that nothing will kill your leader. You are always just one wrong move away from losing the game, yet there is no alert or indicator telling you when your leader is about to die.

The devs expect you to sit there and add up/multiply all of the damage numbers after all of the buffs, debuffs, abilities, and charms. This is the most fun and interesting feature that they could dream up. You already have to keep track of up to 13 counters on the screen, status effects, charms, abilities, turn order, remaining health, positioning, draw pile contents, boss phases, and on top that, they want you to calculate damage.

Easy to understand
Lots of different styles/builds to use
'Overworld'/map paths are interesting as each perk is fairly unique

Cons:
Game combat balance is pretty out of whack. Basically impossible to beat the last bosses without a near-perfect build which requires A LOT of good RNG.

I've had very strong builds completely lose steam because the charms i received were useless (e.g. Weakness: -2 Str; Slow: -1 Attack speed; Consume: Adds consume to item). Plus, the three 'styles' of companions you receive could have no synergy with your build (i.e. Frost main character, and all you receive are healing/Pepper companions).

Additonally, if your companion is injured, it is often a steep uphill battle to help them recover for the next battle since they have half HP/Str... Maybe there could be an item to instantly recover 1 companion per run. Otherwise, if you lose 1 or 2 companions in the 2nd boss, you may as well quit that run; no reason to keep playing with such low odds of surviving.","0.50397878885269165","1683669575","true","1542","1542","0","29","110","0","0","0"

At first it felt so challenging that it was unfair.  But then, I started paying a lot of attention to the strategy side of it, thinking a move ahead of myself, and then I realized that the deckbuilding part of it is less of a decisive factor than the strategy in a given battle.  You often feel like the things the game hands you aren't what you were hoping for, or don't help your current deck in a material way, which I think is part of what people dislike about the game.  But it's far from the whole game.  You will SOMETIMES walk into a crazy synergy that carries you through a few battles, only to find something that counters your chosen synergy pretty hard.  So you can't put all your eggs in one unit basket the way you can with Monster Train for example, you need to develop contingency plans as you go.  

Long story short, I think the thing people are finding frustrating with Wildfrost is that you can't simply import your habits from games like Slay the Spire or Monster Train.  This shares some features with those games but the logic from those games doesn't always apply here.  

I only got my first victory yesterday after 12 hours of playing.  But every run I got better and better at reliably making it further.  I don't even know if the game has been out long enough for people to realize how high the skill ceiling might be on it.

On balance and difficulty: it feels great so far after a few runs. Wildfrost is not an action or long-form tactics game that is designed to usher you through a slow difficulty ramp of encounters. It, like most good deckbuilders (especially roguelikes), presents a series of puzzles to solve. If it were obvious how to win it would be boring. I feel challenged. I feel like I am provided a lot of valid player choice and variety in run builds.

I've reached the end of a run and that felt good. Not sure how the endgame plays out yet. 

(SIDE NOTE: A lot of games like this get tedious when runs become an RNG grind to find the 1 or 2 broken builds that can get past the final challenge. It's especially painful when the final challenge dwarfs anything leading up to it, making the rest of the run tedious. That's what I mean by endgame.)

I see a lot of people saying that X is too hard or Y needs a nerf; everyone's experience is different, but personally I'd really hate to see the devs reduce the difficulty of the game. I've finished Wildfrost and I honestly believe that there were only a handful of times when I died to circumstances outside my control; in almost every fight, when I die, it's because I missed something. It's kind of insane how crazy a fight can look at the beginning of the battle-- for example, the wild hog bonanza; the first time I saw that second wave of pigs come rolling in, I felt a genuine despair. But then I thought it through, and the win felt insanely rewarding. It's still a scary fight every time I come across it, but I don't think I've died to it in the last 10 runs.

Wildfrost's difficulty is really wonderful and unique to me; in a word, I guess I'd say it feels... Fair. I'm not trying to present myself as some kind of gamer god, and I'm not a particularly accomplished deckbuilder (I only got to like... Ascension level 6, or something, in Slay the Spire). I'd never say that Wildfrost is _easy_. Rather, it's just a supremely satisfying kind of difficulty that feels uncommon in videogames-- what it tests is the strength of my focus. Folks have complained about the RNG; My personal feeling is that you can win almost any run if you just pay attention, and in the event that you do lose to a coinflip, it's typically because you opted to rely on an aimless item, or you left your 1HP hero in a lane with an aimless enemy. Once or twice I have found myself with no good options for a leader; I think one time I even died in the Big Peng battle for this exact reason. But those awful leader rolls happened like... Two times, maybe? In 50 hours? And it was also completely hilarious. Maybe this is a marginal opinion, but I've always felt way more beholden to luck playing STS (which incidentally I also love) than playing this. The biggest example of RNG is, of course, the Marrow fight, and that's definitely the part of the game that has felt the most unfair during my past runs, but I don't know-- it's never felt unfair enough to make me mad. I feel like usually you're able to find the tools you need to deal with Marrow within the first 4 turns, and then the fight is pretty trivial. 

The difficulty curve of Wildfrost also has my heart singing. It's a tremendous testament to the game that the first time I beat the frost guardian I thought, 'Damn, I don't think I can play much better than that...' And then I activated the first purple bell and won again. At every step of the journey I've felt like I'm playing at the best of my ability, but then the game gets harder and I find that I can still keep up, because the game is helping me improve through practice. I don't really know how to talk about it other than to say that I'm kind of obsessed with it. I work in gamedev and I'd kill for a team with the balance sense of the Wildfrost crew.

It's kind of hard to reconcile this with the discussions and reviews I've seen from other people (especially some people who mention their A20 wins in STS alongside their lamentations of how impossible or unfair Wildfrost is). Maybe they're trying to move too quickly, or not reading the card text properly? I don't know. All I can say is for this tired ole cowpoke, this is absolutely the definitive deckbuilder experience. I'm absolutely blown away by what the dev team has managed to achieve with regards to difficulty and balance, and I'd be pretty devastated if they succumbed to calls from players to, for example, remove the aimless cats, or nerf (for some reason) the King Moko fight. Everything just feels so finely and tightly curated, with every run being a house of cards that's just one distracted brain cell away from collapsing; I honestly feel like removing that tension could banish the magic from what, for me, is a really special game.

I guess in summary-- keep it up, devs! Trust your instincts with regards to balance, because you've made something really fantastic here. I've got nothing but love for this game.

I feel like WildFrost requires a slight mindset adjustment when compared to similar games in the genre. 

With a lot of roguelikes there is a 'easier' early game time period where you can explore, refine, and develop your decks synergy without TOO much pain to figure out how to approach the endgame. WildFrost shortchanges that. It is good in that it speeds up the process so you are quickly in the scenarios where moves matter, card picks matter, and you aren't just throwing shit down to move to the late game. Every enemy is a threat, every resource should be leveraged, and every fight beyond the first is developed in such a way that you HAVE to be growing in some capacity/direction. 

In my opinion this has some pros and cons:

Cons: 
If the early randomization doesn't play into your favor, (Or you didn't pick the right deck synergy from the stepped available options)  it is quite literally not worth continuing beyond doing some psuedo-dumb unlockable stuff at home base.

Limited early game options against rapidly advancing enemy types leads to a lot of scenarios where if you can't handle a particular type well, (Thorns, Smackback, big slow hits) you often CAN'T scrape by, you just lose. 

Pros:

Runs are shorter. There isn't a super 'brain dead' early game period just to get through to start a part of the game with some actual meaningful decisions.

Much more strategic! You can lose early if you aren't thinking or paying attention, the pay off from an well executed series of plays translates to rewards and that oh so satisfying feeling of mastery. 


Ultimately it's a little different first. I do believe some tuning is needed but all games do at first.","0.522058844566345215","1683667334","true","1007","4048","0","2","657","1","0","0"

Already beaten the game with 2 difficulty modifiers, about to try my luck at the true ending.
I have played Slay the Spire for 300 hours beating the Heart at A20 with every character a couple of times.

Overall:
This game is a 9/10.  Amazing artwork and music, insanely addictive. The reason its a 9/10 is because it doesn't have as much replay value currently as other roguelikes, though this might change in future updates.

Difficulty:
RNG plays a decent role but not more than getting through Act 1 with Silent on A20 in Slay the Spire. Most of the times a run is lost due to your own mistake or miscalculations and the game never feels unfair to me even on the highest difficulty setting. For me personally I would like them to add some more difficulty settings but I'm sure that will come soon.

Strategy and gameplay:
You never lose to the first 2 fights and hence you have time to shape your deck into a certain strategy and this minimises the effect of RNG (aka getting bad cards offered). Synergies are important but are not everything. Also synergies are not as simple as just build around poison, frenzy or w/e.
You need to consider your overall weakness and improve on that. Since certain encounters test you on that weakness you always need at least some decent tankiness, scaling (for huge healthbars) and quick dmg (to deal with annoying stuff quick)","0.539662718772888184","1683665402","true","1102","2058","0","1","0","3","0","0"

It's safe to say that I came for the art style, but stayed for the gameplay. I don't claim to be an expert on roguelike deckbuilders, but as far as I'm concerned, this is a really fun game with plenty of different builds and combinations to try out!

There are still some quality of life stuff that could make this game better in the long run - like a re-roll button for your leaders or a permanent renaming function - but those are nitpicks.

After ~40 hrs I have completed all achievements and the game was a blast. 

Great art style, visuals and an overall polished game with unique mechanics in a deck builder which is always a welcome surprise and I loved all the easter eggs and references to other games. My selling point for this game has got be that each turn is almost like a puzzle with clear solutions if you consider all the variables in front of you; this coincides with the biggest criticism of the game because if you miss one of the 'variables' whether it be due to a lack of knowledge, patience or cognitive ability, the battle can quickly spiral and so can the run. But needing to play perfectly is hardly a requirement to win, it helps alot but I've had many battles and runs on the very brink of a loss, only to clutch a narrow comeback making the wins that much more satisfying.

Some criticisms I do have for the devs is that I find the Clunkmaster clan much stronger than the other 2. Having access to ink as well as stronger clunkers to tank allows them to deal with a wide variety of enemies that most other builds would struggle against. Couple that with events like the gnome traveller which inherently benefit one clan over the others makes me think some balancing could be implemented here. 
Overall the game was great and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a nice challenge but still enjoyable game where learning core game mechanics is rewarded with fulfilling wins.

TLDR:
 Unique deck building rogue-lite that doesn't hold your hand and lets you learn and adapt at your own pace. 
Basic reading and math skills are required, caution playing if you have not yet developed these skills.
Like a challenge? You'll love this game!

I'll offer only that you look at how much play time positive reviews have since their review. This will prove more valuable over time, but even now there are players that gave it a thumbs up and have played maybe one run since (based on time played). Did they really like it or does it just feel better to give a positive review to a very nice looking game? Just like the presentation of a meal or the camera work in a film, looking fantastic only adds to a good experience, it doesn't make one.

I agree 100% with CaptainFop that what needs to change is a consistency feature (like the champion). When everything banks on one card surviving, reducing the randomness of that card could go a long way to aiding the game's replay-ability and satisfaction, essential for a Rogue/Deck Builder.","0.483449697494506836","1683497583","false","1628","1628","0","10","269","3","0","0"

I think most of the difficulty critiques come from the fact there is so much on the screen at any given time that it easy to miss something and lose a run because of it. I'd like to see an option to replay the turn. It would help the feel bads from losing just because you missed that one of 6 enemies on the screen had a single line keyword. I'd also love to see more meta progression as you play through runs.

The art style is amazing. The fighting mechanics are unique and require more strategy than most deck-builders. Only issue is the RNG. I find myself constantly restarting just to get a half decent leader (a button to do that would be great). The first path you take almost always decides the end of the run. Too many of the companions are very specific towards one synergy that can't mesh with your current team. If you get a bad selection on your first two companions the run is basically over with few opportunities for redemption. 

One of the only ways to salvage a run is getting lucky with charms. Which is a great mechanic that just needs a few changes to be amazing. A good charm with the right team can win a run, but most the time you will get something completely useless with your team.

The biggest downside of this game for newcomers is the difficulty. The game beats the shit out of you for the first couple hours with little reward. Once new pets and clans are unlocked it becomes slightly winnable but still heavily reliant on luck. 

All that said, it's still extremely addicting and the good just barely nudges out the bad. I recommend it to certain lovers of STS and monster train who want the feeling of sucking at a deck-builder again. For those who this is their first game of this genre I'd recommend checking out the previously mentioned games after your rage quit Wildfrost.","0","1683493658","true","1585","1914","0","6","273","0","0","0"

The game is great but can be frustrating, with some of the difficulty modifiers. 

It honestly get's worst the longer you play it just because you understand the decks that work to beat 'hard mode' (spoiler friendly), but just going for normal victories stays very fun because there's lots of archetypes. 

Absolutely worth it as the journey to completionist was a lot of fun, however, I will likely not be playing much more of this game now. (Full completion at 48 hours).

The other great positive is I played it with my girlfriend and we had a lot of fun and it was very intuitive for a less experienced gamer. The artstyle is so incredibly pretty and it is very rewarding if you just take your time.

The game definitely demands your attention 100% of the time though - tiny mistakes can and will cost you an entire run, and splitting your attention or not focusing on every variable on the battlefield will lead to really frustrating losses. I think changes could be made to improve this through UI elements and previewing, but if you want a chill game to play out the corner of your eye I would pass on this one, there is a lot to track and account for which makes it mentally demanding.

Before purchasing, I read a lot of negative comments that game is too hard and even first boss is unbeatable. It raised my curiosity and I've checked several videos on YouTube (Retromation in particular) where the game was easy and fun to play. I decided to give it a try.

Disclaimer: I've played for 3 years in 'MtG' (online and offline), and played the 'Slay the Spire' (StS) for 475 hours (I've beat the Heart by 4 heroes on 1st and 2nd levels of Ascension), so I know well what is genre is.

My summary — I would definitely recommend 'Wildfrost' if you looking for something similar to 'StS' but with some new tweaks and mechanics. Here you'll find beautiful artwork, descent level of complexity and places where you need to think several turns in advance in order to pass the boss.

However, if you looking for the same game like 'StS', you do not need this game. You already have 'StS', it's a wonderful game (the best in genre in my opinion).

If you decided to purchase 'Wildfrost', here are few tips, how to make it easier to play:

1) No Rush: please, read all the text for all enemies and all allies before doing the turn. I've lost so many battles, because of some dumb move, where my hero was eaten by an ally, or some additional damage passed because I've misread the text.

2) Try to play dozens of games with an idea to beat the fight, and only then, try to do it in a way of getting more money with setup for combos

3) Check YouTube for some ideas or builds

4) Do not afraid of using the de-buff bells, they will give you more money and additional crown at start. And always pick the Vase even if you not going to beat the True Final Boss

5) The additional Health / Healing is OP: I've beat the Final Boss / True Final Boss only when had the many abilities to heal allies / add more HP to them / or mega combo-wombo synergy

However, this game at its worst can be so ruthless you'd lose if you make even a single misstep. 

If you've played Slay the Spire, it's basically the card synergies from that game but cranked to the max. Each battle you're always deliberating whether you're going to get a chemical reaction with your cards on the draw or on each turn. It's more akin to figuring out a puzzle than it is simply playing cards to win. The way the game works is you play cards that are either units on the board or items that affect those units. They all have turn timers that signify who goes first, and that's when you start puzzling out how you play a fight. A turn passes whenever you play a card, and since many cards have turn timers lower than 6, you have to figure out how you're going to win by playing the right cards at the right time (literally). You engage in different decisions that can ultimately affect the rest of your fight if you're not paying attention, and this is my highlight of Wildfrost. Each card you play has a significant effect, that can either ruin you or get you the win. The craziest part is you're not the only one with synergies, each fight in the game has enemies that sync up with one another in the worst way. It's satisfying when you land a synergy within 3 cards or get out of a hairy situation with the least possible damage. The game's core mechanics help emphasize this decision-making where most of the hours you play in this game will be just AFK, thinking about your next move. 

However, my biggest gripe with Wildfrost has to be dealing with the RNG and limited paths before each fight. When each fight is so important, so is the decisions you make before them. You can only really pick between two paths in the game before a fight, and they may or may not have events you'd like or need. It can sometimes be your own detriment when you don't have a proper way to prepare for a fight with such limited resources. I think this could be interesting, but Wildfrost doesn't give you a whole lot to prep or re-roll for some of your cards. You're given what you're given and that's that, which honestly sucks when the game is already difficult as crap. 

This game is great, but it does have some flaws that can turn you away immediately. It's good if you're fine with that kind of challenge, but I'd rather have a more accessible way to deal with each fight if possible. It's a good game, but a very difficult and flawed good game.","0","1683436833","true","543","2286","0","5","0","0","0","0"

However, the balance kills it. It never seems to fail, whatever build you go for, the game puts you up against your perfect counter and you lose. The status effect ink is the only thing in the game that it doesn't counter and it's the easiest to win with. There are ways to counter your counter, but that is reliant on low odds RNG.

The game is very RNG-dependent. The character you start with, the locations/companions/items/charms you find along the way, what enemies you end up fighting, what reinforcements are sent out during the battle, etc.

A little bit of bad luck prevention on the RNG would go a long way. Possibly just up the number of choices you get whenever you get to choose something. More paths on the map, make harder enemies into 'elites' that are shown on the map, more companion choices on the Frozen Travelers map location, more item choices on the Treasure map locations, etc.

Same thing with showing more info. Let us hover over or click the reinforcements icon to see who is going to show up. Having an enemy that shows up and applies a combat-wide buff or debuff can immediately end a run. If smackback does not trigger when an ally or item hits them, then that should maybe be updated to say 'when hit by enemy', instead of just 'when hit'. Would be great to see a snippet of who you will fight at any given Battle or Boss map locations, so that you can somewhat plan ahead.

Overall, I love the game, I want to see more content added, but I really want to see that RNG toned down in some way. I'm fine with the game being hard, but I don't want that to come from the RNG, I would like to see that come more from how you build you deck, how you play your cards, how you move your companions around, when you return companions to your deck to heal them, etc.

At this point in time, I cannot recommend this game, due to how many runs that go out of your control from RNG and are not fun, before the stars align and you get a fun run.","0.479681462049484253","1683407890","false","2208","2320","0","244","0","3","0","0"

The visuals are great, the card effects are interesting, and the placement of units brings an amazing amount of depth to the battle system.

But the game face plants because it is simply not accessible to people who don't want to do the mental tax of constantly thinking through the complex battle turns for 10 minutes before every single move. 

In my opinion this would easily be fixed if they simply added an 'ironman' system like what Xcom 2 has. Having ironman disabled would add a preview system to the battle screen much like what Monster Train has which would show which units will die that turn and how much damage the rest of the units would take. You could add a questionmark to all units in a row if aimless effects are in play at the time. Then, enabling 'ironman' before a run would take this system away.

Without a system like this, a large number of players will consistently bounce off of this game.","0.409307211637496948","1683394431","false","1275","1781","0","2","0","0","0","0"

In my opinion the game is quite balanced, unlike what a lot of other reviewers say. The final boss is beatable with pretty much every style of deck available and the game usually offers enough tools to deal with every encounter. However, I do think the game is very punishing towards mistakes. Combat in this game is a very intricate puzzle where you have to predict exactly how every turn can play out and how your plays influence that. You have to keep track of positioning, timers, sequencing, cards in hand, cards left in deck and redraw bell timer. You can easily make mistakes without knowing you even made them until turns later, when you're staring at a lethal board without being able to do anything about it.

I absolutely adore this combat system. It's simple, yet has incredible depth. There's nothing quite like spotting a seemingly lethal situation 3 turns down the line and expertly navigate around it after planning out your turns for 20 minutes beforehand. Or setting up your turns for a risky 5x combo instead of safely taking out your enemies one by one.

It's very different from other deckbuilders, where a turn is pretty much self contained and enemy actions don't really interact with yours. In those games your deck has a straightforward gameplan and the difficulty is more in crafting a deck that can keep up with the enemies. In Wildfrost, the deckbuilding aspect is a lot more limited. Your deck doesn't change that much over the course of a run. Usually you take a large part of your starting deck all the way to the final boss.

So the game is absolutely not for everyone, but if you're like me and Wildfrost's combat system just clicks, you'll find an absolute gem of a game, that oozes charm from its artstyle, music and small mechanics sprinkled throughout.","0","1683393443","true","3576","3582","0","1","0","0","0","0"

Most mechanics are copied almost verbatim from Monster Train, yet Wildfrost somehow still feels very fresh. If you like the genre I would definitely give this one a try.

Other reviewers' complaints about difficulty are not entirely unfounded. Player health does not carry over from battle to battle, so defeat comes suddenly and without warning. However, I have always felt that my defeats were avoidable if I had been paying closer attention. The game is punishing but not unbalanced or unfair.

I feel like the 'fun factor' is lower than in Monster Train, and I think this is due to Wildfrost being more fair, lacking the game-breaking combos that made Monster Train so silly fun. But what Wildfrost lacks in silliness it makes up for in strategic depth.

The immediate trap people seem to fall for is trying to make their entire deck synergize with each other, but the golden rule of action economy applies. Characters are very strong since they will always apply as well as taking hits. Making sure each card is viable in a vacuum is almost always a better take unless you already have a strong character to work with.

So in that sense, the game is very straightforward and most archetypes are very viable. Snow is ridiculous for giving insane amounts of value for a single play. Poison stacks incredibly fast as long as you have a character + an item. Ink counters like every build but teeth and a few others. Only the healing cards seem rather too slow to be easily done, but maybe I'll make it work at one point.

If you're seeking a very diverse challenge, I wouldn't recommend this to be the deckbuilder. But if you like cycling a 10 card deck and watching opponent giant numbers whittle away surprisingly fast, this is a pretty fun play.","0","1683344584","true","1075","1775","0","3","0","1","0","0"

But there are still stuff I'd like to be added to the game, such as a run recorder where you'll be able to look at your past runs and analyze them for mistakes, and it might be good to add more companion and enemy cards, or add more battles (or maybe create some sort of survival mode, where you try your best to get as far as possible, though if you were going to create that you'd need more cards so the mode doesn't get boring or repetitive).

All in all, I think this game is great and I do recommend, but there are definitely some more stuff I'd like to be added to the game. The way you win this game is by anticipating the boss fights, since the same few bosses appear in each of their respective boss battles (ex: first boss is either Bamboozle or Infernoko) and then choosing the correct cards to deal with them. Many cards are versatile, so your options aren't limited, there's just a certain strategy to beating the game is all.

I love the strategy of this game and having to plan out what could happen multiple turns ahead and with the difficulty keeps me on the edge of my seat because a single bad move could cause you to lose. Many other people have said the game is too hard and I agree. Its hard because of too much random luck determines your success. I believe that through no fault of your own you can very often lose the game because you could not get anything good or coordinate a strategy. This ruins the game and almost made me not recommend it. 

The strategy, challenge, and presentation are top tier. What brings the whole experience down is how little control you have over customizing your deck. The issue is you don't know who you will face, so it is hard to account for every possible enemy you will face. What is worse is that you only get to pick from 3 random cards from the entire pool of cards. You can't guarantee that you will get anything that synergies together. Take monster train for example, which does the deck building elements much better. You pick 3 cards from the 2 factions you've chosen guaranteeing some level of synergy and the ability to develop a strategy. 

You will lose many times in a row because you can't get anything that works together to form a decent strategy. Then everything will align and you will have a great run. I think this game is more fun that monster train but this game has high peaks and low valleys in terms of fun and frustration. I think a few tweaks to what cards you can get to help you have more agency when deck building could really improve the game and make it a lot more fun.

For now, if you like rogue like challenging strategy card games and are okay with occasional frustrating runs I would recommend this game","0","1683330557","true","821","1203","0","10","0","0","0","0"

The primary complaint seems to be that the balance is not correct, often making the game very difficult. I agree that the game is very difficult, but as a player coming from a slew of other (often very good) deckbuilders, I personally find the difficulty refreshing rather than disheartening.

In many other deckbuilders, once you understand the game, winning becomes very easy. The fun of the games often come from feelings like 'can I make this strange build work?' or 'I've never had such a crazy synergy!' but winning the game often becomes a given. Most games offer some ascension system, often with dozens of levels, to mitigate this, but while they give a satisfying sense of progression, they rarely increase the difficulty to an insurmountable level.

My win rate in Wildfrost is close to 10%, even after mastering many of its mechanics. But rather than leaving me with a feeling that the balance is too punishing, losing a run often motivates me to roll the dice one more time to get a better deck, and when a run is going well, it is thrilling given that it is so rare. As Wildfrost also has an ascension system and meta-progression, I feel like I have ample motivation to keep playing.

I'd like to call out one major complaint and I hope it is addressed in the future. In Wildfrost, when your champion dies, the run is over, so it is very punishing of misplays, as a single misstep could result in your champion being killed instantly. Fortunately, there is very little randomness in-battle, so rarely does a mistake feel like it was out of your control.

However, rounds of combat in Wildfrost play out like elaborate puzzles in which the player needs to use multiple pieces of information to visualize how the enemies will behave, and how they can counter that behavior given their units and cards available. This makes Wildfrost's combat feel like playing chess, but while in chess an opponent is required to declare 'check' when they are one move away from winning, Wildfrost has no such system. This frustratingly leads to many runs ending because I missed some key piece of information that resulted in an enemy I thought was safe for the round one-shotting my champion. Developers, please add a 'check' system to alert players that the game state will result in a loss at the end of the turn unless changed!

Even in these scenarios when a lost a good run to a mere oversight, I still was excited to start again to see what kind of new deck I would come up with, so in the end I'm still finding the game very enjoyable, engaging, and challenging (in a good way)!","0","1683318873","true","1290","1680","0","3","649","0","0","0"

The gameplay loop isn't going to make you put hundreds upon hundreds of hours into the game, its too 'complicated' of a game to do that, but it is still simple enough where you can pull it up, do a few battles, and then put the game down again
And rinse and repeat until you 'beat' the game, which honestly is pretty simple once you have learned the game
Then you play the game some more, unlock more, learn more, and so on - and you do this until you fight the final boss of the game

In short, is the game worth the asking price? Yes
But this genre is full of games that are famous for 'pick up and put down'-play that can last you 1000+ hours ... so I think if you go into the game looking for something like that, maybe you'll be able to find it if the game gets DLCs/updates
However it isn't the 1000+ hours game other games that are so common in this genre

So I recommend this game for new people who want to try out Roguelights, but I also recommend this game to us who are used to the '1000+ hours'-games because Wildfrost IS a good game, and it has ideas that should be viewed as a massive success that other games simply cannot achieve because they are built perhaps 'too much' for repetition and loses out on what an end-point and 'finished' game can be like

Its a weird, but lovingly crafted, and thoroughly enjoyable game that I wholeheartedly recommend","0","1682540462","true","1716","5606","49","48","235","0","0","0"

Played cards are arranged in a 6 vs 6 grid of two rows, and everything on the board including your summoned allies and the enemies has a timer (usually 3 or 4) that 'ticks' whenever you take an action. These played cards (in the form of your hero card, your ally cards, and the enemies) will take their attack against whatever is across from them in the row when the timer ticks down to a value of one. It's a deckbulider, but one where it costs a 'tick' to redraw your hand, UNLESS you spend enough cards from your hand to get a free redraw, very interesting way to reward you trying to play out your hand, or cost you to go digging for the combo. It's incredibly clever and leads to lots of very interesting interactions and board states that reward planning ahead, as you can see things ticking down from each action.  Of course being a roguelike, very satisfying upgrading of cards - you can acquire 'charms' that attach to cards and modify them in weird and wonderful ways.

It does a very cool thing when you beat a run, your cards and companions get possessed by the big darkness, it kind of takes your setup of cards and turns them into the end-boss which you have to take down on your subsequent runs. Turns out my first run was just an absolute heinous mess of thorns, smackback and 'explodes on death' mechanics that it took me another 50 runs to beat it again lol.

Presentation is 10/10 - clean visual design with a fun art style and music.

Learning curve can be a bit rough, especially if you're not someone who gets into strategy games. Also just like the best roguelikes, sometimes you do run into situations that if you don't drastically play around them will seem absolutely unwinnable and unlucky, especially while you're learning the game and interactions. But there's usually an out of some kind if you see it coming early enough! Which, is an incredibly rewarding experience. Only negative is that I think some of the cards could do with a slight rebalance, and it would be cool to see a bit of charm/reward tailoring towards the tail end of runs as sometimes you get given stuff that doesn't interact with what your setup is going for. I think these two negatives are so minor compared to how good of a game it is in totality.

Also - a game that just releases in a finished state, for full price, and is just... polished and good? In 2023?? This is how games should release.

After reading reviews complaining about unfair RNG, deckbuilding limitations, and the game being too complicated and difficult in general, I almost missed out on this gem. Now I'm glad that I didn't!

Even when upping the difficulty with more and more 'evil bells' each time, I still manage to win 70% of my runs - so you'll manage just fine as well. Also, when I lose, it's always quite obvious where I made a mistake. 

The whole point of the game is to make do with what you can get and to keep strategizing all the way to the end. Find a companion that doesn't fit your plan? Put them in reserve and never look back.
Find a charm that doesn't help you? Hold on to it, as it could come in handy later in ways you didn't anticipate.

Let's say you find a multi-attack companion early on and decide to build your deck around stacking buffs on them to deal BIG damage. Simple and fun, right?
You KNOW that at some point you'll run into a fight where enemies will have a damage-return ability (teeth or smackback). What will you do?

A) Take measures to deal with the threat - such as direct damage cards to remove the backline enemy that gives everyone damage return, freezing 'smackback' enemies to prevent their retaliation, or using 'ink' to remove key enemy abilites altogether.

B) Watch your super-companion kill themselves by bashing their head into damage return enemies 4 times in a single turn - then proceed to write a negative review on how your 'build was countered by the game'.

If you'd rather go with A, then you'll have LOTS of fun with Wildfrost!

It does feel like there are some balance issues, but nothing that can't be ironed out in a patch. Even just adding the option to change round timer tie-breakers to favor the player might be enough to tip the balance to something a little more fair.

Edit: After playing for an additional 4 hours I can say that the balance needs more work than I initially thought. I've played a few games now where I feel like I played a near perfect game and still lost due to RNG. In the later stages if you get a bad draw and a card that doesn't exactly fit into your current deck then it's a waste and makes the next battle much harder. No re-rolls or way to trim your deck besides wasting another valuable action node before a battle. On top of that, waves of enemies come out insanely fast and special boss abilities like deploying to backline are a run killer if the RNG gods didn't give you anything to either yank them forward or hit them wherever they are.

It's got card variety, cool deck building aspects, card upgrades, and a really cool rebirth mechanic. However, there are a few things holding it back. The main thing is player power. I've done a bunch of runs and even beat the game a few times and never once have I felt overpowered. Even if I get a good snowball rolling this game is really good at taking your team apart if you're not careful. I'm not asking for a super easy game but I do want to feel like I'm invincible every once in a while. It's okay to let the player have something overpowered every once in a while. You can have a card with 3 good charms on it, good team support, and a slim consistent deck and you still aren't in a perfect position.
It wouldn't be fair of me to criticize the game's balance without providing some suggestions. First of all, there are a lot of cards and charms that have very similar effects. Usually they comes as a pair with one being far better than another. There are two big offenders that come to mind. As far as charms go, there is a charm called the Battle Charm and a charm called the Moose Charm. The Battle Charm increases the attack of a card by 2 while the Moose Charm increases the attack of a card by 3 but at the cost of increasing its sun counter by 1. If you've played the game you know how important having and maintaining a low sun counter is. So why would you ever want the Moose Charm? +1 attack is not worth an increase in the sun counter. Additionally, since the Moose Charm mentions sun, you can't use it on items like you can with the Battle Charm. The worst part about it is the way use receive charms. Unlike items and minions, which you get to choose from 3, charms drops give you one random charm and you're stuck with it (outside the charm merchant). The nail in the coffin is the fact that the Moose Charm is an achievement unlocked charm... so I suppose it would have been better to never have unlocked this achievement. To better balance the Moose Charm I would suggest making it like the Durian Charm and have it increase attack by 5. The Durian Charm's 'drawback' is that it removes the effect of a card. Which isn't always even a bad thing. For the card example, I want to point at the Clockwork Bom vs the Bom Barrel. The Clockwork Bom applies 2 Bom (sometimes 4 if you're lucky), and deals 2 damage (again sometimes 4 if you're lucky)... before the bom is applied. Meaning it doesn't benefit from its own bom status effect for some reason. The Bom Barrel, however applies 4 Bom... every time... to EVERY ENEMY. Yes, it deals no damage but if you really need that 2 damage your tribe comes with hammers that do that anyway. On top of all that, the Bom Barrel also gives you 4 junk which synergizes with your other cards in your tribe. So why, I ask, would you ever choose the Clockwork Bom for that niche use case over the powerful Bom Barrel? I say make the Clockwork Bom apply 3 bom every time and deal 3 damage that benefits from its own bom status (6 damage) to make it more comparable to the other items of its caliber from the other tribes (Azul Battle Axe, Berry Blade, and Hongo's Hammer). I would say even let its chance to double stay.
My last power based gripe is this set of companions that do 0 damage and all they do is apply a status effect. They are all objectively bad, except maybe the Bom one and the Shroom ones because they kind of do damage indirectly. So, the heal one, the spice one, the snow one, the demonize one, the double overburn one, and especially the haze one. All these companions barely do anything, doing nothing sometimes, and are an active detriment in the case of the haze one. What a waste of good art and could have been more interesting. If you have a companion where all she does is heal, you aren't killing the enemy. You are better off grabbing their damaging counterparts. Give these companions some attack for pete's sake.","0","1683187996","true","1085","1761","0","16","0","0","0","0"

It's challenging, rewarding, and severely punishes you for not paying attention and trying to wing it, which is okay by me.  The game sort of borrows bits and pieces from a ton of different deck builders and combines them into something new with a few twists on the formula.  

After beating it once, it starts to feel like an unfair slog on higher difficulties unfortunately.  There's  no winning without lucking into certain synergies or getting the perfect charms to imbue your fighters/items with.  Sometimes, your starting champions are straight up dog tier and you might as well restart.  A lot of higher difficulty runs it seems depend heavily on getting certain OP units or items and if you get the mediocre stuff, which there is more of than I'd like, you won't last too long.   

All in all, a great little card game, doesn't have the staying power of a Slay the Spire, but explores some new ideas and has great ambiance to back it up.","0","1683136369","true","5382","8038","0","20","0","0","0","0"

(Meta-commentary on difficulty will come at the end of the review) The TL;DR review is that the game is fun, unique, and can be played casually while also offering a good deal of strategic challenge and new possibilities at the high end. Wildfrost receives a strong recommendation, especially during future sales.

Art and Design: 
There's not much to say about the art style and graphics that isn't grasped from the store page. It's simple, charming, and lends itself well to the gameplay. You'll know if it suits your tastes based on the footage. One fun thing to note is that each playthrough, you must choose from three heroes with random names, abilities, and designs.

Music:
The music in Wildfrost is fun and lively without becoming too bombastic or monotonous while playing. The soundtrack may become repetitive through several playthroughs or long sessions, but helps foster the game's fun and charming atmosphere as you play through and try to beat the game for the first time. Generally, after I beat the main campaign for the first time, I've idled the game while listening to audio books or podcasts, and it's perfectly suitable for that as well.

Gameplay:
The gameplay loop manages to be easy to understand and experiment in while also allowing the player freedom to use preferred cards, abilities and strategies. As the difficulty increases, and with later game mechanics, the player is tested on their ability to understand and counter enemies and their own strategies. While Wildfrost might not have as much replayabiltiy as a game like Slay The Spire, there are plenty of ways to approach the game, and craft current and future runs with careful decisions and planning. There are always opportunities to ask yourself if a strategy or combo could work, and to challenge yourself to make it work.

Onto the discussion about the game's difficulty, there was a large percentage of players on release that felt as if the game was unfair in its difficulty. While those feelings may be subjective, I would like to claim that Wildfrost overall is quite middling in difficulty for a game in its genre. Players who are new to roguelikes or deck building games might struggle to understand concepts that older players would think as obvious. However, there are no mechanics or strategies in Wildfrost so esoteric as to be unrealistic for the average player to uncover if they gave it a shot. The game can be beaten by anyone willing to get through their first few runs and learn the general mechanics and most consistent strategies. There is optional content that can be quite challenging and potentially require some amount of luck, but this content is completely optional and does not take away from the normal gameplay loop the average player will return to.","0","1683135805","true","8000","23309","0","18","0","0","0","0"

-A very solid, strong game for 20 USD, with 30-60 hours of challenging gameplay.
-UI is crisp, gameplay loop is clear and engaging, and there are quite a few build paths for decks. Art and music are amazing and very cohesive.
-Let the game stand on its own: anticipate needing tactics and careful positioning and itemization to win. Do not expect to play Slay the Spire. They are different titles for a reason, and therefore bring something different to the table.

Addressing a few other reviews I have seen, at length:
-There is ~30 to 60 hours (or more) of content to fully beat the game (as of the time of this review). I think that is more than fair for 20 USD. More content in the future would be welcome. (Deeper card pools after 'initially' beating the game, or additional Hades-esque Heat levels.) Not every game has to be a best seller, top-of-charts game for you to have a good time, and this game delivers quite well.
-Games are designed to be difficult, but beatable. Like any Rogue-like and deck builder, there is a tremendous amount of player agency. This game does a VERY good job at pacing when new enemies and new cards are introduced, such that the player eventually is exposed to the full array of cards and foes they can expect to run into in a reasonable, but not unfair, time frame. If you lose, it is because you mismanaged resources, or forgot that 'Aimless' actually reads 'Kill Target Player'. ;)
-Do not anticipate this game to play like other games you may be familiar with. StS , Monster Train, what have you. As a long time MtG player (+Shadowverse, Lophis, Hearthstone, Ashes, Star Realms, etc) I am familiar with varying takes on how card games and deckbuliding games operate. You should not expect every game to operate along the same axes that games you already enjoy. Yes: Wildfrost is a 'deckbuilder'--provided you think of picking your companions and supporting spells added to the deck as building an entire deck. Crowns let you effectively 'First Five' Companions/Clunkers/spells that you think you will need, which is already significant departure from how many card games operate. To win some nail-biter fights, you may need to sacrifice your entire roster of Companions, which are then injured. 

All this to say: let the game's mechanics and gameplay speak for themselves. It isn't for everyone, but no game is. To compare it directly to the other (voraciously popular) card games in its genre is a disservice. If you want to play StS, just go play StS.","0","1683134627","true","3053","6196","0","1","0","0","0","0"

If you had to put down a comparison with other games, I would say it is a mixture of Slay the Spire, Monster Train and Into the Breach. Deckbuilding feels similar to StS, combatpositioning/-placement reminds me of MT and the gameplay/turns remind me a lot of ItB. Most of the time there is a perfect play, you just need to find it. In the beginning that is kinda hard also considering the deckbuildingpart but once you are somewhat used to what are the strength and weaknesses of each class and your current final boss, you start getting winstreaks.

Here are some other feedbacky thoughts I had while playing:
I love the art style and animations but I wish there was more atmospheric sound between the interactions on the map.
Some interactions are weird, like the order of when a silence happens from items vs from characters.
Controller support can be fiddly, like when placing 3 or more crowned units in the beginning, navigating in town or selecting charms in your inventory if you have 3 or more.
It would be nice if bosses showed if they have a second stage (just for us explorers who don't read excel sheets and guides on how to play the game)
Frenzy can work weirdly or not at all on some items (like the destroy item on hand and add Atk to random Ally).
Demonize bugs some cards sometimes (e.g. had a Berry Blade not restore HP).

I'm very addicted ATM but I see potential to get bored in a month or two due to limited content and classes feeling somewhat like there is only 1-3 ways to play them but right now and for the price of 19,49€ I'm more than happy and recommend playing it 100%","0","1683123381","true","3131","7031","0","5","0","0","0","1"

The game is quite literally amazing, quite possibly the best roguelite I have played in years and the negative reviews don't do it ANY justice.
The game has amazing artwork and is visually beautiful throughout, not to mention the strategic depth the game has is pretty absurdly large despite the smaller amount of content. I will say, I do not think the game is currently worth 20 dollars with around 20 hours of content MAX and even less depending on how good you are at the game.

I’ve made it to the final boss once, but I spend most of my time battling the exact same intro battles over and over again when I inevitably lose a few rounds later due to the random factor of the rewards given. Fully willing to admit this is partially because I’m sure there are things I’m not doing right. 

The town is a bit misleading as well. There’s not really anything to do/ see and it builds up pretty early in gameplay. It’s just lots of different challenges you have to complete to unlock a new card.  Such as use ‘X’ ability 20 times.

Basically I would love this game if there was some more variety to the first levels, or other rpg ish elements to the town in between runs, or maybe even just different environments to start off in.

As in Monster Train, all of these card types can be upgraded with charms to create new effects and synergies — though these effects are relatively understated.

The inspired part of the design, however, is that where these games have a system where you expend energy each turn to play cards, Wildfrost combines the concept of energy and turns. Each time you play a card one turn passes — and, as each turn goes by, the units on the field tick down towards their next attack. Rather than dumping and redrawing your hand every turn, you instead have to either waste a turn on a redraw or play a certain number of cards to get a free redraw. Thus each battle is a race against time, trying to maximize the effectiveness of each card play and organize your battle lines to absorb or preempt each attack.

This core design is tremendously impressive, capturing much of Monster Train’s explosive possibility space while still retaining much of Slay the Spire’s elegance. When it works it feels great: Each action is of monumental importance, each position of each unit matters, an immaculate and immediate tactical puzzle. However, the perfection of the broad strokes of the design is somewhat let down by some of the specific design decisions.

A lot of runs tend to end due to oversight of or confusion about incoming damage, suddenly losing your best unit to an attack you didn’t see coming. I’m sure many expert players will respond “git gud”, but I don’t think it adds much to the tactical puzzle of the game to force the player to calculate incoming damage from all sources and predict which unit it will be applied to: Some sort of incoming damage preview would be very helpful, not just for preventing unpleasant and confusing surprises but also for teaching the rules of the game. There are some tricky cases here, of course: What do damage previews look like for enemies with the “aimless” trait? Perhaps a range of damage, or perhaps just appending a “?” To the display. Should a preview appear when you’re about to use a skill that would change the outcome, or would that incentivize players to just try to preview everything and brute force solutions? Similarly, when applying a charm to a card, it would be helpful to see a preview of what the finished card will look like — it’s not always obvious how charms will interact with each other or with innate card abilities. Though the specifics are tricky, it’s still the case that a few such simple UI changes could make the game significantly more straightforward to play and easier to pick up.

Some issues are a bit thornier. When the player is asked to select a card, it’s not uncommon to be offered a choice of one of three cards which are simply not useful in the current context. Skipping an item card is not allowed, so every item card encounter has a non-trivial chance of making your deck slightly but significantly worse. Card removal events can be encountered in the world, but since they can often only be visited by sacrificing the chance for a shop or item card they can really only be used to strengthen an already-powerful deck and almost always are used to remove starter cards, leaving any duds found later on in encounters to drag you down. The net effect of all of these choices is that it’s quite common to feel trapped in a bad run, unable to strip away the cards that are bogging your deck down, slowly accumulating more of them as you’re presented with more unappealing choices with no chance to remove them.

A good way to fix a lot of these issues might be to expand the functionality of the shop. Compared to Slay the Spire there are very few cards available for purchase, just one more than in a standard treasure encounter, which makes them barely better than such an encounter for the purposes of finding a card which makes your deck better than worse. Compared to Monster Train, the charms are all randomized and unknown, so spending 50 gold can completely arbitrarily yield something that suddenly makes your deck unstoppable or something that’s a completely useless joke. Expanding the shop with a couple more cards and with a finite and visible selection of charms that can be strategically and intentionally purchased would go a long way, as well as adding some sort of purchasable card removal. It might, perhaps, even be worthwhile to have separate charm and card shops, adding a bit of depth to the decision of which node to visit.

These problems could also be addressed to some degree by simply increasing the number of encounters per stage of the game, though some events might need to be reduced in effectiveness or frequency to counterbalance the additional encounters.

The final major issue I have with the game is that the three current tribes — factions which determine what cards are available to you — do not seem equally well-considered. The Shademancers, centered around summoning and sacrificing units…  simply don’t seem to work very well at the moment. The first issue I encountered with this faction is that almost their entire starting deck is taken up with 5 Tar Blade cards, an item which does damage equal to the number of Tar Blades in-hand. This is a pretty boring card to start off with so many of, and not an especially strong one. It is, moreover, one that only gets weaker as the game progresses and your deck grows, one that doesn’t meaningfully interact with any of the tribe’s core mechanics, and one that can’t really be strategized around. Another significant issue is that a number of cards have special triggers on “sacrifice” — that is, something special happens when they’re killed by the player instead of by an enemy. The problem is, it’s not really clear what counts as a sacrifice. Does attacking something covered in spikes and dying as a result count? (No.) Does dying due to losing HP over time count? (No.) Does being destroyed by an allied unit’s active effect count? (Yes.) At each juncture, the player can make educated guesses about what might count as a sacrifice, but there’s really no way to be sure — another place where, perhaps, some form of combat preview would be helpful.

There are other issues. The “Soulbound Skulls” card, which randomly selects one enemy and one player unit to soulbind, making one unit die if the other one dies, is effectively a 1 in 6 chance of instantly losing if it happens to target the leader. The preponderance of units which can only function alongside one another, relying on sacrifices and deaths and triggers which can only happen once you manage to get several of them, makes each individually untakeable and the beginning of the game a hellish slog where the player struggles to find a single viable unit. The flavor of the faction and the core mechanics are cool, the interplay between them can be really fun, but the whole thing doesn’t seem designed in a way that acknowledges it’s in a deckbuilder and that you’re not going to have all these resources available, you’re going to have a few of them if you’re lucky enough to find them.

The core design is incredible, the visual and audio presentation are fantastic, I have had the soundtrack stuck in my head for weeks. I hope all the stuff mentioned here can get ironed out, because I think with a little reworking this game could be one of the all-time greats.","0.650083363056182861","1683057494","true","437","437","0","17","0","17","0","0"

They don't waste any time getting you to the gameplay, the lore is extremely concise while still serving up enough flavor to support the aesthetics and all of the metaprogression stuff is super quick to check without feeling insignificant or completely removed from the world. The visuals are, well, probably the reason you're considering it in the first place, but I'm making a note of it here specifically because all of the mechanics in the game are very deliberately characterized. This may seem insignificant, like yeah of course the thing looks like what it does. But most TCGs and deckbuilders I've played have been pretty inconsistent about this. In MTG, you know it's poisonous because it says infect on the card. In this game, you know it's poisonous because it's green and covered in mushrooms. 

If you're thinking of picking it up, I'd take a lot of the reviews with a grain of salt. It's not the tough-as-nails unforgiving betrayal of expectations some of the negative reviews would have you believe it is, but if you're new to deckbuilders your learning curve is going to look a lot steeper than what most of the NL viewers down here had to go through. The board can get pretty hectic and there's definitely some him-me-him-him-me algebra involved. Still, there are worse places to start and it gets you going damn fast as long as you're excited to learn.

The balance is fine, just add more purple bells to make it even harder for experienced players. Like a bell that demands your oldest non-leader character dies after every 2 boss fights so you have to keep rotating your team into a new composition.

There are so many synergies and interconnected systems that it feels like you always have the chance to craft an insane build. Every turn feels intense but not overly so. 

The game is dripping with polish and style. The music is great and gets you in the zone every time you fight a boss. There also seems to be a ton of replay value. There are squads I haven't even tried out yet and plenty of unlocks and daily runs.

For gameplay, it's much more similar to 'Into the Breach' rather than 'Slay the Spire' as far as strategy goes. The deckbuilding is still important, but it's your turn-by-turn decision-making that wins you the game as opposed to building the perfect deck. You can absolutely save a 'meh' run by making some strategic outplays. It's so incredibly satisfying to string together a combo and lock down a once-dangerous enemy.

The game feels extremely fair, as the board gives you almost 100% of the information you need to know exactly what will happen many turns in advance.

This game is HARD but amazing. It took me tens of hours to get my first win, and probably double that to get my second. If you are thinking, 'I played deck builders. I'm surely better than these amateurs saying the game's too hard,' no, it actually is just that hard. Part of the reason is the biases you have towards strategies and the number of harsh lessons it takes to break those habits. If you watch a streamer play, almost half the suggestions chat makes are bad, and the majority would lead to a quick loss if taken. That being said, the game stays fun the entire time and is only hard while you learn from it. I got two wins on my day off when I had time to actually play a lot of runs. This game harshly punishes any errors, which you will learn from and improve for the next runs.

Additionally, while the game is often devastatingly hard, the amazing music is always motivating you. For example, listen to 'Sunbringer' on YouTube. It both makes you feel hopelessly outmatched but makes you feel like going down swinging. As you start to get the upper hand, the song's emotion switches from hopelessness to triumph through hardship.

The biggest issue in my opinion is you have to focus the whole time. This isn't a difficulty thing, its a mindset thing. If you zone out while playing and forget to calculate everything on the board, sometimes you can accidentally die and a whole 1 hour run is over just like that, even if you are doing really well and would have won. When I play the game while tired, I do find it really hard and keep dying in stupid and preventable ways. 

In my opinion, the devs could fix this by having a flashing warning light over charachters that are at risk of dying the next turn from the enemy moves. Although this won't always fix the problem, it would be a great quality of life improvement for me. 

When I play this game while focused, attentive and awake, my win rate is about 50%. But lots of quick deaths to stupid things when tired has brought down my overall win rate to 20%.

The game is incredibly dense. Every fight will introduce new mechanics, it will be a bit overwhelming at first, and you'll find your clever build suddenly gets hard-countered by some stupid cat. But learning and planning for these circumstances is kind of the point of the game. And as you get better at the early game you'll hopefully get enough gold to cover all the bases.

My only complaint is that as you unlock things your pool dilutes a bit. I really love the charm mechanic, it's an inventive way to customise your cards, but spending your crown money on a random penguin charm is pretty painful.

While I admit some runs I feel like I just got unlucky, this is also a game where you can [spoiler]drop a 1/1 chicken, soulbind it to the final boss, and then instantly knock it to phase 2 on the first turn[/spoiler].

Every fight is a puzzle.  It is a tough game at first. Prepare to think through turns, and not just slam cards like in Slay the Spire. Sometimes one mistake can cost you the game, but IMO it is pretty well balanced.

I think negative reviewers may be new to deck builders, or have simply forgotten what it is like to be at the start of new roguelike deckbuilder. You might lose all the runs for the first 10h. It's OK, you will get there eventually.

I love deckbuilders and I LOVE a challenge. When I picked up the game a lot of negative reviews said it was too hard which only made me want to play it more, but I want to try and articulate why people might think it's 'too hard' because that's actually something I feel is a core issue in the game's design. 

To me, a better comparison for this game to other deckbuilders is Monster Train, primarily because of how it offers decisions to the players. You have diverging paths which give you two different sets of options, and then they reconnect for you to experience a new battle with your presumably improved deck. I believe that in Monster Train, they made this decision space sufficient for you to feel that your runs are winnable. If you lose, you can still look back on your run and consider what decisions you could have made differently and how they may or may not have changed the outcome. I do not believe Wildfrost provides you with a decision space where that is true (or where it at least feels true). There are a lot of reasons why I think this is the case.

The biggest is that you don't have a persistent HP stat between battles in Wildfrost, each battle is independent. The problem is this means you can't have a bad matchup. In StS or Monster Train you can accept some losses in a battle that you know is bad for the way your deck is built as long as you make up for it in other battles. However, in Wildfrost each battle is won or lost based on whether you can keep your champion alive. Sometimes this leads to interesting in-battle decisions, but more often it leaves you feeling like you find the tools to answer the wide range of upcoming battles or you don't, and when you don't there's very little you could have done differently.

The second is the randomly generated champions. It's an interesting mechanic on the surface, but in games with as much RNG as a deckbuilder it's important to understand your constants. An option like your champion or your class gives you a foundation that you can build on. While randomizing the champion does offer novelty, it means that your only constant is the underwhelming starter deck of your chosen tribe.

To win, you would want to improve upon that deck. However, actually accomplishing this is an issue in terms of the card design itself. So many of the cards are fundamentally reliant on certain synergies to be effective. It's possible (even likely) that when you choose a companion or item from 3 or 4 options, all of your options will only be good given the proper synergies, whether that's having the appropriate cards already in your deck, finding the right charms, or hoping to find the synergy later. If you find perfect synergies, you can trivialize fights. If you find just enough synergy that's great and you can succeed with good play (these are the most interesting runs). However, if you find none or have to make decisions in the hope that things come together, you're left with a deck that is fundamentally ill-equipped for the upcoming challenges. Synergy is fun, but part of what makes high-level play in a game like StS work is understanding when to make decisions that help you scale your deck's capabilities, and when to make decisions that help you create a more well-rounded deck with answers to a variety of challenges. In Wildfrost, it's very rare to get the right resources to create a 'well-rounded' deck because so many of the cards and charms are so conditional, and you as the player have such a limited number of decisions that you even get to make over the course of a run to begin with.

There are still things I like about the game. The art style is very fun and a lot of the mechanics are novel enough to make the game a unique experience. I did enjoy playing the game for a while. I lost some early runs because I wasn't paying enough attention to the state of the field. There are a lot of little details to keep track of, which personally I enjoyed. It made learning combat a lot more interesting.

If you're still here after reading my unnecessarily long review I think I'd summarize by saying I enjoyed learning the game, but once I learned the game I just felt frustrated by so many design decisions. If you're not interested in sinking a ton of time into improving your play, you might enjoy learning the game as well and that might be enough for you to feel like the game was a worth playing. However, if you're like me and you want a deckbuilder where once you understand the game you can really start to dive into its nuances, you might find Wildfrost harder to come back to.","0.840471267700195313","1682953808","false","1567","1639","0","3","301","723","21","0"

this game is incredible. if Slay the Spire is deckbuilder Dark Souls, Wildfrost is Sekiro. Come in thinking you can dodge roll to victory and you'll get wrecked. It is extremely focused with less freedom but when you get to grips with it, the difficulty is perfect and the close fought wins all the more rewarding.

for context i love rogues, i enjoy deckbuilders but theyre not my fave genre. im solid at them not elite by any means. i LOVE StS, thought monster train was ok, hearthstone, not loved. gwent yes! BUT Wildfrost has easily become my fav. At first it feels oppresively difficult, but after a few unlocks (i see u OP bushoo) it really starts to click. Each run feels truly unique and really forces you to adapt, plan and strategise based off you increasing knowledge of the enemy and your own synergies. it really is amazing to experience your own growth and progress through knowledge instead of progress systems. hence my original Sekiro ref. The devs should be REALLY proud, this is a lesson in game design.","0.502923965454101563","1681569558","true","878","3254","0","6","0","2","0","0"

The game is just so crisp and legible while still feeling full of character. If you consider yourself to be a deckbuilder roguelite enthusiast then you really have got to play this.

Except for the soulbound skulls card. Fuck this card. Why can it target your leader when it says 'ally' on the card? Devs please fix this!

The game gives you plenty of opportunity to plan ahead several turns, there's a ton of meaningful decisions in every single battle because even if you're really powerful and can trivialize a fight - you still wanna optimize for getting combo kills cause it nets you money with which you can get stronger later! All the things you love from deck builders you will find here.

It's easy to overlook a glaring problem that can kill you out of nowhere. Perhaps your hero attacks a dude you've always had stunned but now it's not stunned anymore, and it turns out it has counterattack and just kills you because you forgot - things like that. Always your own fault, but it can be a little frustrating! In such a case I take comfort in Foxee. Foxee is love, foxee is life.","0","1682891230","true","1173","1592","0","11","0","0","0","0"

Generally if you think ahead and read enemies carefully you can beat most fights. The one exception is the final boss for the true ending. It has a particular set of mechanics that invalidates most builds. You basically have to build specifically to cheese that fight, or you don't have a chance. I'm talking 'never let the enemy take a turn' type of cheese. It's definitely winnable, but the game doesn't guarantee that you'll actually roll the tools necessary to do it, so you'll have a lot of aborted runs looking for JUST the right RNG for your build to come together.

This one definitely leans on the more difficult side and absolutely needs some balance passes because RNG can man-handle your ass sometimes (whoever decided forced aimless on teeth level deserves to stub their pinky toe on a desk every day for the rest of their lives, real smart). This trending 2-lane choice meta rogue system is lazy as fuck too and the game will feel against you if you don't get to focus your needs

There has to be a cap or something on what can be placed as the true final boss, getting a great run that carries you will only cause infinite failure when you have to defeat yourself and it chooses all your crazy stuff to beat you down with. This on top of lazy 2 lane pathing makes it very difficult to reach those power levels. While not impossible there is still so much RNG involved that it feels like you are just punished for trying to play and enjoy the game.

Don't even get started on bells too, adding charms to enemies is such a joke. Wanna see your run ended? Just wait until a chonker spawns with high teeth. Not to mention for whatever reason you can't inspect the mobs to read what the charms even do.

I still love the game and will continue to play but hopefully the game will be updated further to address some noticeable problems. Will update review in future.","0.480911701917648315","1681786162","true","1343","3270","0","46","567","0","0","0"

What are they talking about? This isn't nearly as difficult as some of the other popular deck builders like Slay the Spire or Monster Train. Heck, it's even easier than freaking Dicey Dungeon. Admittedly, some cards aren't very good, but they stand out pretty starkly from the rest of the reasonable stuff, and I figure they're just signs of growing pains and will be balanced later (it's literally like two cards from what I've seen).

What seems to be the problem? I'm honestly at a loss, this game is perfectly palatable. It's no Slay the Spire, but absolutely nothing is, but I prefer it over Monster Train. 

Game isn't hard. This isn't a case of get good, be smart. You need like middling attention and the ability to do simple addition and subtraction. This is a case of read the three word blurbs and connect the dots. My two only real complaints is that it's a little sparse on content and that some of the money is going to Chucklefish, who, in an unusual fashion for an indie game publisher, aren't very good people (Toby Fox and Concerned Ape dislike them). That doesn't have anything to do with the dev though, who I fully support (they made Caveblazers!)

It's certainly the sort of game where you need to slow down, take your time, and really consider each round of play and deck-modification decision before making any moves, but if you enjoy deeply involved strategy games, and the sort of mind-stretch that comes from considering several moves in advance, then I think you'll get a lot out of this game.  If I were to search for comparisons, I'd say it hits the same sort of groove that games like Darkest Dungeon and Inscryption do.

The only negative reviews you should take to heart are the ones where people say it just isnt for them, which is completely fair. But to say the game isn't balanced completely neglects the depth and strategy this game wants to put forward for players to learn.

This should not put you off as it does not diminish the fact that Wildfrost is an incredible game! 

The art style is aesthetically pleasing and deceptively simple. This is contrasted by an intriguing and relatively, but not overwhelmingly, complex deckbuilding roguelite. You are given a variety of companions, cards and paths to choose from which make your decisions matter both gameplay wise and during deckbuilding in each run. In my opinion these are a huge part of the appeal of the game overall.

If you aren't convinced of the game's potential yet, something wonderful that Wildfrost does differently is offer a unique inclusion of intriguing charms. These add another layer of depth, contributing to increased options for the viability of your companions and cards in each run. This leads to hundreds of fun and interesting card interactions.

These features combined make for an excellent game warranting enough replayability value. My one gripe is sometimes I'll create such a fun and unique deck that I'll become so invested in it and not want the run to end! 

Overall, I would highly recommend Wildfrost to both those new to this genre and to deckbuilding roguelite players alike! 10/10","0","1682839050","true","4317","4321","0","1","0","0","0","0"

Normal ending wins become somewhat routine once you get a good idea of each tribe's play style. True ending wins are way less consistent and really shouldn't be attempted every single run unless you like losing (me) or want to flex true ending winstreaks (also me)

-Good simplistic graphics
-Easy to use interface

-Many card combos work in creative ways.  You will keep finding new stuff well into your many many runs.

Cons
-There is a tutorial, but there is much it leaves you to figure out.  Some things I didn't learn till I was watching a streamer play, after I had spent 10-12 hours in the game.  I'm sure there are still things I don't know
-One bad play can ruin a run.  I personally enjoy the challenge, but I know this can be very off putting for some.
-Sometimes even an amazing run gets countered by an enemy team and still can lose.

The core mechanics of this game are, for the most part, great. The tactical elements are interesting and there's quite a bit of depth to the decision making in battle. The presentation is also fantastic. This game is presently good, but you could build something on top of it that is a lot better still. I'll vent a few of my grievances below, but be aware that they're the flaws in something I ultimately enjoyed a lot.

A lot of people say this game is difficult. It is, but the biggest problem here is that the game is very unbalanced. Some items are incredibly strong (such as removing all enemy abilities for 3 turns), others are completely useless (such as reducing a single enemy's damage by 3 for a single attack). Followers all fall roughly into one synergy-pile (poison, snow, shield, soulburn...) and there's basically no cross-utility. A soulburn guy will do you very little good in anything except a soulburn build. The paths to success are ultimately quite narrow, obvious rather than creative (put Yuki, apply snow) and in large part down to luck for whether you can get them off the ground or not. Some charms in combination with certain items or followers are almost automatic wins. Others are almost entirely useless, such as reducing the damage of one of your own cards by 2 (there *are* use cases, but they're niche and mediocre even in the best cicumstances).

Another annoyance is that when you add in the bells (which increases the difficulty and lets you get the 'true ending') the randomized charms on enemies are incredibly frustrating. Normally in a roguelike, you can get familiar with enemies and their patterns and develop plans for what might come ahead. However, if the slow enemy with a lot of health and snow resist randomly rolls a charm that lets him counterattack for free whenever he gets hit, you're done. Game over. Unless you've stumbled upon the exodia of item/charm/follower setups, no ammount of skill or planning can save you. Randomness that you can't plan for isn't good.

All in all, the above points sum up to an experience where you feel like you're very much at the mercy of the game. There's no 'making do with what you get', if the stuff you get isn't good you just lose. A balance pass and giving the player a few more options at card rewards/shops I think would alleviate a lot of this frustration. Bring down the obvious cookie-cutter hyperscalers a bit, and make the average card actually worth spending a turn on past the first boss.","0","1682816507","true","1306","1795","0","1","0","0","0","0"

You have to make sure you're reading every unit/card properly and there's more interpretation required than most games in the genre that favour perfect information but as a MtG player it comes very naturally. 

I imagine anyone familiar with a physical TCG would find it similarly easy to understand and be able to understand they misplayed (or got themselves into an impossible situation) rather than getting frustrated at the game.

There is a lot of real skill that goes into this game, you can see some people who are very meticulous with their actions being very well rewarded for their deliberation and thought, and the game pulls this off without just making things more complicated.

Difficulty is alright.

I think implementing an optional preview for people wanting an easier experience would help, though it might be difficult to implement with the random mechanics in the game.

The games beautiful and I'd recommend it to anyone, after grasping all of the different mechanics it's a ton of fun. Definitely worth $20.

For anyone who doesn't want any spoilers, scroll on.

I managed to win twice however it does seem that certain setups are insanely hard to beat after they are converted to the final boss. I have no idea how I'm going to beat my smackback/teeth comp now that it is the final boss as every team I've gotten there with has crumpled under the damage, but I'm not willing to give up yet.

I would appreciate an attack order, I don't think it's necessary to show every outcome of the next fight, but i think it would be a nice inclusion to number the enemies and allies order of attack, even if you have to inspect each card to determine it.

Can't wait to see any updates or DLC's come out for it, although even without them I'm sure I'll be playing it until I unlock more of the content!

Yes, you will absolutely get demolished if you try to speed-run. There's too many variables at play and it's incredibly easy to miss a game-ending ability. However, of all the games of this genre I've played (most of them), this is the one that has had me consistently coming back for more. 

Some basic tips:

- Move your cards around. It's mandatory, you will not win if you're not spreading damage or maximizing abilities. Remember most abilities only activate in a single lane. Look for 'Barrage' on the enemy side, don't let it get one of your glass cannons.
- Don't be afraid to ditch your hand. Use the feature to look at the remaining cards in your deck and make a tactical decision. Many times I'm dropping my entire hand because I need access to better cards. 
- Balance attack/defense. There are encounters that will wreck an imbalanced deck. Either you'll be taking massive damage or enemies will have multiples layers of spikes/shields. The one rule of thumb I use: go for longevity more than anything else. Most games I win are because I was able to outlast the other side. 
- Prioritize crowns. They are broken. Simple as that. 

I've yet to hit my 3-win streak, but I'm getting close, and having a ton of fun in the process.","0","1682798585","true","1503","1551","0","3","312","0","0","0"

Maybe these complaints are true for those peoples' experience, but it has not been true for mine. ]
Enemy and boss spawning is unpredictable the first time you fight certain bosses, but as you learn certain enemy patterns, you realize they are predictable. I would argue this is part of the skill curve of the game, which is emphasized by how the additional difficulty tiers work - After you beat the boss the first time, the additional difficulty tiers add random modifiers to enemies that change up the old patterns. Additionally, I've been able to win with a variety of builds on both normal difficulty and at the first tier of added difficulty. Still cracking at the second tier at the time of this review. 

Besides addressing the negative reviews, it's also worthwhile to highlight the game's positives. The art, music, and sound design are all very charming and deeply satisfying. The mechanics are complex but allow for very interesting combo plays and decision making. Overall, a game where I found both simplicity and depth in places where I did not expect them.

Often when a misplay has cost me a run, I can reflect on the mistake and take that knowledge into my next attempt. Generally, I've felt a rewarding sense of progression over my 20 hours so far.

There are a number of mechanics to keep in mind: card placement, turn order, status conditions, recalling, buffs and debuffs, etc. It takes a bit of time to fully understand how they all function and interact, but it is accessible learning in the sense that the game gives you visual feedback to understand what is going on if you take the time to process between turns.

Beyond mechanics, the card art is absolutely gorgeous and that charm is further exacerbated by the immersive soundtrack. A lot of thought and love appears to have been put into this game and it shows.

My main area of critique is that the campaign itself feels a tad short, and whilst all of the enemy compositions are extremely creative, there isn't that many in the grand scheme of things. As it stands now the game has been an incredibly engaging experience, but I could see it getting stale without some solid updates. That being said I can see there is a daily run with a pre-built deck, and that'll keep me around for a little while.

(Writing this review because 
1. I genuinely love this game and 
2. To get the game rating up to what it deserves :) )

Yes, it is tough, and one lapse of judgement or overlook will certainly end your run. BUT the combat is challenging but fair because the game presented you with ALL the information on the board. So when your unit attacking the unit that generate thorns when hit before your leader with 1 hp you trying to protect attack it and died? Well, it's your fault that you didn't pay attention to the order since the game give you all that before you played this very turn.

It will be different from most deckbuilder that you play the hand you dealt turn by turn. This is NOT the case for Wildfrost. 
- The order you deployed the 2 units in hand might be the difference between you winning or losing the tempo of the fight.
- or A poison card played one turn too late 4 turns ago thus not having enough poison stack to kill the boss.
- or A turn using snow card on one enemy that mitigate the damage this turn but resulting in 3 other worse enemies attacking next turn with nothing to defend yourself at this point.

In Wildfrost you have to not only deal with immediate threat at hand but also required to think ahead for the next few turns. 'Who is going to attack next?' 'Do I have enough turns to set up my combo or I have to play something else first because all the enemy is going to attack and kill my set up before that?' 'How will I survive 5 enemies attacking for 2 more turns so that my units will take care of the rest of the fight from now?' And I thoroughly enjoy this process of thinking.

Since it's a roguelike, you will not always get a combo or synergy that you want, but you have to make do with them. I firmly believe that an average deck but methodical play can get you very far in one run. On the opposite end, you may have the greatest synergy of all time but one mistake during battle could means the end of your run. 

There is no easy gimme in this game. Every decision along the way both in battle and outside of battle means a lot to a run. Every battle is satisfying. There will be a learning curve but I guarantee that when you get that first win, it is so rewarding. Many times than not, I often asked myself 'How in the world I am going to win this fight?', and when you BARELY beat the boss by one hp or one turn. You will truly appreciate the beauty and complexity of this game.

Balancing of some cards are still needed, but every deckbuilder will need balancing after came out so I see this as a normal process and I am sure constant balancing by the dev will always be the case for a while after the game came out.

I do recommend everyone still hesitating to give it a go for yourself! If it's not for you, then fair play. But if it is for you, then I can guarantee you will have found yourself one of the most challenging and fun roguelike deckbuilder to date.","0.523809552192687988","1682183369","true","423","1353","0","1","122","1","0","0"

You can definitely win with many different builds that are all unique. The bad reviews are, unfortunately, from people who the game didn't click for or they didn't have patience to ensure they made the right play. It's a beautiful and challenging game. For me, that was the refreshing cup of coffee I wanted.

One of the games it reminded me of was FTL. FTL was unforgiving; I still haven't unlocked half of the ships, but it's a great game. What happened to appreciating the challenge. Do we just want a game that makes us feel good about winning or do we want something that you have to learn, adapt, and improve?

The art is fun and colorful, some cards even have their art change as their effects trigger; very cool touch! If you enjoyed Slay the Spire, buy this game. It scratches the same itches (except the aesthetic, which is obviously VERY different).

If you're unfamiliar with rougelikes, it basically means you'll lose. A lot. Winning a run is the exception here. That said, even failed runs can help unlock more content, which can help in future runs (or just make them more interesting). Your first win will probably require a dozen runs, if not more. As you learn how to take advantage of the systems, that win rate should climb, but even experienced players will probably only win about a third of their attempts.

This isn't a perfect game: it's often hard to figure out the order of events in a turn, and I managed to crash it on two separate runs (thankfully it auto-saves, it just required me to reset the game and avoid repeating the action).

It took a couple runs but the game really clicked for me and I got a win in a handful of hours! What I enjoy in the game that’s different than the two mentioned games is it’s progression of the town. it’s more than just playing and losing to get some xp for more cards for future runs.

There’s a handful of challenges that when completed will unlock more charms (buffs to your cards), allies, pets (an ally you choose to bring before you start your run.), items, and events. This brings you to trying builds and getting certain items in a run you might normally wouldn’t. For example there’s one where I had to buy 10 crowns, which is a shop item that let’s a card be in your pre-starting hand. So I had a couple runs where I would play 4 card before the turn counter went down at all. (turn counters are when an enemy and allies attack, each card played brings the counter down by one.)

Wildfrost has a lot of layers in its combat besides blocking and defending. Similar to Monster Train you have to keep positioning in mind, however in Wildfrost you can reposition your champion and allies anywhere before playing another card. 

Also some bad reviews will say the bosses and mini bosses counter your deck and you have no idea, welcome to slay the spire like games Lol. I made a shiv deck, oh look it’s Time Eater again.

Anyways I just love the charm and look of the game lol.","0","1681787408","true","84","2853","0","76","334","0","0","0"

It does take some time to find good synergies and strategies, but it feels very rewarding when you're able to get good ones in your run. Every build I've won with so far has been very different than the last, and I feel there's many I still haven't touched.

This game basically is the 'I'm a genius. OH NO!!!' meme in a nutshell. And I love every second of it.

Of the deck-building genre, this Wildfrost leans more towards Monster Train or Duelyst (rather than say Slay the Spire). The 'deck management' is somewhat more abbreviated, but that does not mean it is any less deep. Much of the game  difficulty is the tactics layer of an individual encounter.

Most negative reviews seem to be centered around this difficulty - but it is really a game that requires patience and deliberation - a turn can take several minutes of consideration and decision making to assess. A single wrong move can be absolutely debilitating. But with enough thought and some initial learning ramp, you can orchestrate an absolute symphony of destruction. And it is beautiful.

This is a gorgeously illustrated, witty, tactically intricate, and charming game that has a ton of replayability. Beware of one-more-run-syndrome.

Some things that I personally look forward to be improved:

- Better ability descriptions (you figure it out after a while, but they can be a little challenging to understand at first).
- Less reliance on certain abilities (silence/ink is incredibly strong).
- More leader variation (you can often get the identical leader abilities in two factions as part of your initial pool, and some are non-viable).
- MORE STUFF - I want more of everything - more charms, cards, factions, special events, more more more...","0.697141766548156738","1682725873","true","4527","8430","0","2","0","31","0","0"

A lot of the difficulty stems from the initial learning curve. Going in blind, it took me quite a while to understand how some mechanics worked, what to do against certain enemies, and what to prioritize.

I feel like this game could use a few QOL changes. Being able to reroll your starting leader options would be great, as sometimes I want to play one specific tribe. There could also definitely be some improvements to the new player experience through more in depth explanations or tutorials. Maybe an easy mode with increased leader and companion stats would be helpful for new and casual players.

I often struggle with information overload in card games, but Wildfrost shines at letting very simple rules create complex decisions! There's not much to understand, but a lot of options to consider.

This game isn't easy, and for people with lots of deckbuilder experience, don't worry—later difficulties are deeply challenging and add a bit more variety!

The main change I'd request would be increased warning of danger: when I lose runs, it's usually because my tired eyes glossed over one really important number, to catastrophic effect. That said, a full preview would be challenging to implement because of the game's semi-frequent use of the 'Aimless' random effect? But it might be helpful to e.g. call attention to units at risk of fully dying. For now, you'll have to pay attention, but the simple mechanics help a lot with that!

I wanted to take a look at the demo and I was captivated after just a couple of runs. I was really interested if they could expand upon it and beyond the first boss and I am very pleased.

I was concerned when I first saw all the poor reviews but as I played and gotten more and more coverage of the game I believe that the harsh nature of the game is because a lot of players are unfamiliar with the genre and mechanics. There is no preview to what cards will do so you need to take your time when you are first playing this game and to make sure you understand the order of operation for each turn. A lot of the complaints about the difficulty I believe can be negated with a bunch of planning ahead of time, all the enemies are on a set timer so you will not get caught off guard by their turn. This is one of the games where you can and usually will have to plan not just your current turn but the ones in advance, even playing around with the bell counter. 

I've gotten much better at this since the game has come out, but I still fall into the lulls where I play too quickly or I think I have the turn thought out in advance but my placement/order/math doesn't check out and I mess up. It's easy to do that since a lot of games show you gratification and you want these runs to be done quickly. I was hovering around 3-4 wins before I watched Retromation. The way he plans out his turns and his combos to maximize the most out of any hand or combination is impressive. He really showed that the RNG aspects of the game doesn't really come into effect once you know how to lessen it's impact. I'm not at that level yet, to get consistent winstreaks but it's always something to work to. 

A lot of players have concerns that there are certain builds that you need to build towards or have certain synergy. I feel like there's not that many streamlined builds once you start playing. Daily Voyages show me that there's ALL types of cards and interactions you can play with, the difficulty modifiers and the bells obviously make the game more difficult. The fact that even the most detrimental cards have uses with niche applications is so cool. Cards that can be activated on hit, using a 0 damage card will proc them, getting rid of a status, lowering the enemies count or your own to activate a certain condition. There are so many interactions and when I play I'm always checking my deck and the cards to see if there's some interaction to be had.

Of course there are some issues with how some cards interact, if you join their Discord there's a changelog channel with updates from Will. I hope the game gets more and more content, because there's more room for challenges and new cards.","0","1682719703","true","2238","2428","0","11","179","0","0","0"

From the moment you start, Wildfrost thrusts you into its sprawling, icy and artistically detailed world teeming with a myriad of foes to test your mettle. The game’s difficulty can be daunting, though there is a balance patch in the works as of this writing. For right now, however, the sense of achievement when overcoming a seemingly insurmountable boss or pulling off an incredible combo with your carefully curated deck is nothing short of exhilarating. I expect this to stay the same after the update as well.

The deck-building mechanics are intricate and thoughtfully designed, offering an impressive array of strategic options once you start unlocking new events and starting characters / equipment / pets. The leader tribes you can play as are well balanced and each one is unique, providing a specific way to play the game. Building your deck is a delicate process, requiring shrewd decision-making and a keen eye for synergy. The game encourages you to experiment, learn from your failures, and adapt. Each playthrough is an opportunity to try new combinations and strategies, making every game feel fresh and exciting.

The graphics and music are beautifully done, conveying a frigid yet whimsical cartoony atmosphere that perfectly complements the intense, climactic moments of chaining together your combos or avoiding fatal blows. The user interface is intuitive and the game’s tutorials are clear and detailed, ensuring players understand the mechanics.

The game’s roguelike nature, coupled with the deck-building mechanic, offers immense replayability. The procedural generation of the leaders, deck, and charm variety ensures that no two runs are the same. Each run presents new challenges and opportunities, pushing you to constantly evolve your strategies.

Wildfrost is a testament to the roguelike deck-building genre, offering a challenging yet rewarding experience. It's a game that will push your strategic limits, reward your efforts, and provide countless hours of engaging gameplay. It’s a tough journey, but one that is deeply fulfilling and absolutely worth undertaking. So, brace yourself against the cold and step into the icy expanse; a world of strategy, chance, and epic battles amidst the frost and snow awaits.","0","1682718704","true","1565","2432","0","19","509","0","2","0"

This is a very unique deckbuilding rougelite that encourages you to plan multiple turns ahead in order to maximize your value which will be needed since they throw some really tough encounters at you!

Difficulty in this game isn't just high numbers on the enemy side. There's some really fun and unique mechanics that you will likely die experimenting with. My first 10 hours of the game was filled with run after run where I'd find a new mechanic, test the limits of building around it, and faltering after making it much further than I expected. I was really sad each time since I wanted to recreate 'that deck' again, but with the way that starting a run works. The first hero you pick will often dictate the direction you'll be taking your deck so it's difficult to run the same build more than once in a session.

I also thoroughly enjoyed the way this game handled finishing runs. I'll leave out any spoilers, but suffice it to say after my first victory(?) I felt extremely compelled to keep going and find out what I was missing.

I haven't even gotten into the game's visual style, music and general theming which are all on point and fairly unique in the genre. Every character is very round, soft, and appealing, the soundtrack is really well implemented with dynamic changes when the first blow of a fight is dealt and once the boss properly shows up. When it comes to animations, I particularly like the effect of cards getting stained by blood, goop and poison as you go through your run. It's a constant reminder of the trials you've been through so far.

If you're at all interested, I'd give this game a shot. It has a steep learning curve but if you can learn from the failure there's a lot to love.","0","1682714882","true","2805","3470","0","10","392","0","0","0"

That last one I'm joking but you get the picture game is hard, and while a solid portion of it is how skilled you are, more of it is luck. It's slay the spire but even more luck dependent.

Wildfrost has a tighter variance than some Rogue/CGs in that you don't get the super OP runs that you can get in comparative games.

A few mechanics and card interactions are not that clear and need to be tested but it is fine.

One of the thing to understand, which is not explained that well: each turn the counter of all allies and enemies cards in play go down by one, starting from the enemy, and including snow.

Comparing to the obvious goat Slay the Spire, the game is much shorter and can easily fit in a 20min session. Since this being only the launch version and there are many updates to come, I am very excited for the game's future to be among one of the best.
With that being said, the game is still on the lighter side as a card game. The number of cards is just not large enough for synergies and crazy combos. As a roguelike game, the progression is also way too short considering there is less than 30 cards to unlock.

I achieved a victory and my deck is going to be the next final boss, with increased stats. It's interesting but I definitely don't look forward to that.

I refunded the game. Will MAYBE pick it up later after significant discount.","0.452218323945999146","1682594195","false","91","91","0","22","0","2","0","0"

Shortly after my first win, I got a 5-win streak. Goes to show that the game is not reliant on luck, it just takes a lot of knowledge and familiarity to be able to make the right decisions to win.
Edit: After 32 hours I beat the true final boss! Once again with Tiny Tyko :P Now to get the few remaining unlocks.
Edit: 43 hours and I've now 100% completed the game :) All achievements and unlocks.

Great game, crazy combos are loads of fun! Takes quite a bit of learning to get past the mid point of the game. Other procedural perma-death games have several 'final' bosses, the earliest few being fairly easy to get to and beat; Mom in Binding of Isaac for example. This game's first 'final' boss is very tough to beat which may prove frustrating for less skilled players. I hope the devs will add a few easier, earlier bosses before requiring the player to surmount such a tough challenge.","0","1681518995","true","488","2851","0","26","458","0","0","0"

If losing consistently in the first 50 games without making it anywhere near the end is a deal-breaker for you, then this game might not be your cup of tea.

As for me, I've played almost 80 times and have only managed to make it to the final boss once (which I suspect is the last one). Considering the $19 price tag, I think I got my money's worth with over $1/hr value. I highly recommend this game for fans of Slay the Spire who aren't afraid of a challenge.

The game's card mechanics are quite diverse, and actions such as adding a card to the field or using cards can end your turn, unless you have a buff that prevents turn end on use. Enemies' turn timer counts down first, which means they get to attack first, and poison takes effect after attacks, so it won't prevent an attack. However, there are various ways to manipulate the turn order by using specific cards to reduce turn timers or buffs that trigger certain cards to attack. Even after 75 playthroughs, I still found new ways to trigger certain cards.

The game field is a mirrored two-row with three slots on each side totaling six slots. The left side is for the player, and the right side is for the enemy. Monsters start on the field, and the champion + crown card (more on crowns later when I talk about shops). Turns end when a card is played on the field in most cases. After a certain number of turns, enemy reinforcements show up until a boss is spawned. Combat ends when either the boss or your champion is defeated, resulting in a win or loss.

After the first fight, routes start spawning. There are always two paths to choose from, and as challenges unlock extra events, the routes become more varied and offer very strong buffs, often for money. A word of caution, however, both routes do not spawn instantly, so it's best to wait a second for both to be fully revealed. The common route options include caves that grant around 50 gold, shops that let you buy cards, crowns, and charms, frost-trapped adventures that give one of three champions, and finally, chests that have three cards, of which one needs to be picked. 

The crowns purchased for 80 gold in each shop need a special note as they allow a card to be played for free at the start of the battle to support your leader.

With so many different ways for cards to interact, having no ability to skip card choices on a route can be a coin flip. Players must learn the interactions between cards and how to progress through battles/challenges to upgrade their cards/champions with charms. Many times, I thought I got a nearly useless card, only to discover later that it can become a very powerful option with a charm. I'll discuss this more later.

Champions are cards that attack after a specific number of turns and have special effects, such as healing all allies, gaining more damage on kill, or multi-attack. You start with one of six champions called a pet, however pets are really only a help early on.
Charms, on the other hand, are static buffs of progression that can be added to just about anything in a deck and can give extra attack, healing, or something else entirely when used. For instance, if you have a card that gives four max health and then a charm that gives barrage (hit everything in a row), you can buff all cards in a row with four max health.

Both champions and charms can avoid/retire a route's choices, which is an added bonus. If you choose them, you can either save them for a card or for champions and leave/pull them from your active deck into a reserve pile. This is critical as you can react dynamically once you identify the types of enemies you are fighting. The only issue is that you can’t know what type of new type of enemies you may meet after the boss.

Depending on your start, you can probably kill the first boss, but getting through the second is  impossible without figuring out good synergies. However, do not lose heart. Focusing on challenges that unlock new items, pets, and champions is a very easy way to gain flexibility for builds. Through the flexibility and understanding you gain, progression can be made.","0.523809552192687988","1681500978","true","797","2112","0","40","0","3","0","0"

Unlike the other major roguelike deckbuilders I've enjoyed (namely Slay the Spire and Monster Train), this game forces you to think several more steps in advance. If Slay the Spire has you thinking about the current turn and the couple turns after, Wildfrost has you thinking about your current turn and the next 5 after. In this way, I find the game to be more akin to a puzzle game. There is less variety in the deckbuilding elements, but you still do run into insane god runs like you do in other roguelikes. Aesthetics and art are phenomenal, there's a few QOL things that can be added too, but if you're second guessing your purchase of this game, I would push you to give it a try.

Nonetheless, if you're a fan of the genre and you're willing to spend the time wrapping your head around the mechanics, I'm sure you'll enjoy it. It honestly doesn't deserve all the negative feedback they've been getting.","0","1682634830","true","2920","4882","0","4","109","0","0","0"

Wildfrost battles take longer and you need to think carefully about your moves and what decisions you make. One of the best part of this game has, is that it saves the battle, if you have to stop playing.

It might not be better than Slay the Spire or Monster Train, but it's definitely on a similar level.

Let me start by saying the soundtrack is absolutely mindblowing and the art is also phenomenal. 

The mechanics seem simple, but there are so many interesting and fun interactions. Positioning and order of attacks are super important. There are many combos and synergies you can create. I love how you can upgrade cards with charms to make them unique. 

You fight many of the same fight configurations each run, but they are always fun, and different builds will require different ways to deal with hard situations.

So many negative reviews complaining about it being unbalanced and unfair, too difficult.
So far haven't found it that difficult, was able to use Foxy the companion and dominate with them on my second try of the game and i'm not that great with video games. Again, maybe i got lucky on that run though.
Charms are super fun and incredibly powerful. The cards can help enable the charms effects, concentrate on getting the right charm for the right card and the run seems fun and easy. 
The game as a whole seems so polished and fun to play. I'll update the review if i run into some balancing issues.

Edit: Getting my butt kicked now lol. The game could do with a reroll function when you get options of charms and cards or even just one extra card choice. But still having alot of fun

Edit 2: I went on a 27 lose streak before i was able to beat the game again. Game needs some balance tweeks for sure but negative review bombing is just going to hurt the game. It's difficult but still having alot of fun

Overall the game is great. The art-style is amazing with so much love to detail - from the swinging trinkets you attach to your cards, to the easter-eggs stashed in the vendors shop to the every single battleground: wildfrost is eyecandy. The gameplay feels fresh with its attack-timers, companion-mechianic or trinket-system and the game invites you to experminet and play with certain synergies and combos. Influences like Monster Train or Slay the Spire are defenitely there but wildfrost feels like it's own thing. 

The Bad: 
The map inbetween battles lacks information. You only see your choices up to the next fight, no further. Also no information about what you will be up against. Feels like a lot of guesswork sometimes. 
The powerlevel of the chosen hero sometimes vary widely and for being your lose-condition (your run ends when your hero dies) they are fairly easily being one-shot. 

Overall I loved coming into this game and I am glad I played it for the ~10 hours so far. 
However, to hook me like a Monster Train or STS it defenitely needs some changes
I can't recommend at this point, but I'm sure this will be an amazing game soon.","0","1682585697","false","697","977","0","25","0","1","0","0"

After playing this game daily and many failed attempts with 2 wins under my belt, I just had to come back to edit this review. I understand where a lot of people including myself became thrown off at picking this game up casually. However, the wins are very rewarding, and learning from your mistakes makes it even better. I really hope the devs do not change up the difficulty because I wouldn't want it any other way.","0.446516871452331543","1681346062","false","68","50088","0","2","0","3","0","0"

The fun comes from building skills in planning, strategy, and an understanding of the games mechanics. The best games in the genre offer new players a challenge that is <probably> surmountable for a player who does not yet know what they should be preparing for, encouraging good habits and offering greater challenges for those that succeed, until the game is at a difficulty that only the diligent student can surmount.  

As a roguelike deckbuilder, Wildfrost utterly fails to accomplish this goal. This game offers no board for players who are struggling to attain wins. The game does such a fantastically bad job at offering learning opportunities, that most players who struggle will wash out. 

Worse yet, players who finally achieve their first wins in the game are rewarded with... making the base difficulty setting even more difficult by replacing the final boss with one that will need very specific strategies to counter. Compounding on to this, the Leader units in the game are randomly generated and you are presented with a choice of a single Leader from each clan. So while the boss you are preparing for may need a specific mechanic to counter, you are only presented with a single a choice of Leader for the clan that offers those mechanics to the table. You may need the clan with snow or maybe ink, but fun times ahead! The only Leader unit you get to choose from that clan may not be able to fight their way out of a paper bag. 

Even for the players who breakthrough the game's hostility toward new players, the deckbuilding aspects also leave much to be desired. Charms are extremely high variance, only being offered 1 at a time in most circumstances. The game does not present the player with enough information to prepare for the challenges ahead, so deckbuilding often feels like mitigating negative scenarios that may never even occur. Unless the player high rolls a highly synergistic combination of materials, builds rarely feel cohesive toward a single strategy. And with few card remove opportunities and no option to decline card drafts, decks often bloated with the 'least bad option'.


None of these characteristics necessarily make the game 'bad'. But they do make the game aggressively hostile toward players who are new to tactics. The game in its current state feels like what a deckbuilder should feel like at the end of the players journey to learn the game. If the player comes to the game already knowing the skills they should be learning from the game they are probably going to become die-hard fans of the game. But few others will spend much time here in its current state. The game in its current form is headed toward a small population of dwindling super fans, and that sucks for the developers and for the players who want to enjoy the game. 

These problems can be surmounted by the developers, should they choose to do so. The developers could introduce features which make the game easier to learn, and then offer the removal of that feature as a 'difficulty bell' for higher ascensions. For example, charms could be a 1 of 3 choice to new players, but the 1 of 1 returns at higher difficulties. Ditto that for Leaders. New players could be alerted to a losing game state, and experienced players could remove that alert as a difficulty option. There is a lot of room here to offer a game that encourages players to keep learning the game. Unfortunately, if the developers listen to the die-hard fans, these options will never see the light of day.

 In its current state I cannot recommend this game to the average fan of the roguelike deckbuilding genre.","0.490621358156204224","1682596811","false","1638","1788","0","14","391","6","0","0"

[b]WHY?[/b] The difficulty curve is not really a curve, it's more like a light incline followed shortly by a ninety-degree incline. The first boss battle in a run is not so bad. You can get caught in a bad spot either there or even in a regular battle if RNG gave you a crappy main card but reach that second boss fight? 

The game takes that personally. This is because in the world of Wildfrost, the phrase 'I am going to fight the second boss' loosely translates to, [b]'Please viciously brutalize my stupid genitals while my parents watch, daddy.'[/b] 

I am recommending the game because I worry that difficulty in gaming has become taboo and any title that willingly terrorizes the player is a breath of fresh air. Casual games are fine, but we shouldn't be afraid of a game that requires some trial and error to progress. 

That being said, the uptick in difficulty is so immediate here that it can become incredibly frustrating early on. Go into the game with some patience, the RNG is 100% going to violate you. Repeatedly. You'll lightly build your forces, manage to clear a few tough creatures, and then the opponent will, without warning, gain five new creatures all ready to hit for fatal damage. Instances like that really kill your motivation to try again and it would be better if this difficulty was not so sudden.

However you will unlock more cards, you will learn new strategies, and eventually ... you'll only get [i]politely[/i] brutalized by the second boss. But for $20 at the time of this review, try it. Sounds and effects are smooth, cute, and lovely. They help soften the blow.","0.476190477609634399","1682584463","true","97","117","0","12","425","0","0","0"

Its unique card game system makes the player think of new strategies on the go. Each turn feels like a puzzle the player has to solve. I saw a bunch of negative reviews that blame the game's difficulty. Personally, I enjoyed the difficulty. It made me think of new strategies to tackle my problems. The developers have announced a balance patch is coming though so rest assured. It was well worth the 20 bucks.

Tips for the game in case if you're struggling with the difficulty:
1) Damage cards will get you through the first few stages of the run; companions and status effects will get you through the end of the run
2) Generally, Clunkmaster runs will yield better results due to the fact that they have access to some of the best status effects in the game, that being ink and bom. With that said, I have successfully finished runs with all 3 groups using various builds so Clunkmasters aren't completely necessary to beat a run.
3) Try to get to one gold cave early into the run so you can buy stuff later
4) Once you unlock Muncher as an event, use it. You don't want to open up to a hand full of cards you can't use in the late game.
5) For most general runs, take draw +1 or timer -1. Companion capacity +1 isn't that useful in most runs since you'll be forced to thinly share out charms.
6) Scrap cards are awesome. Those cards being able to tank a hit regardless of damage while also providing useful buffs make them a game changer.

With that said, I did have some gripes. Overall, the game is fantastic fun but there are some things that did annoy me
1) Please add a reroll leader feature. I know you can start a run, exit to the menu, and then cancel the run. A reroll leader button would just save the player the hassle. 
2) This kind of ties into point 1 but balance between the leaders are non-existant. Some leaders are unplayable while some leaders are demigods that turn the game trivial.","0.476190477609634399","1682571380","true","1870","1870","0","3","0","0","0","0"

Pros: 
Final Bosses are incredibly creative and changes each time (I'm not going to spoil it but it's very well done)
Great theming and generally well designed cards that are straight forward
The randomness of your starting character is refreshing and means you have to play differently every run
Decent difficulty but certainly more than doable when you play well. I won my first game after 5 runs and I am by no means an expert. It's not slay the spire level of hard though.
A lot of the game revolves around positioning, rather than card choice. I think it's a unique style and I appreciated mastering it.

Cons:
Not enough content, I have played 13 hours and am already burnt out due to the lack of enemy, companion, and boss diversity
The path you take only having two branches means you're limited in the options you can take
The game feels very short, could be a positive but I feel like there is a distinct lack of fights between bosses and they are always the same ones.
The lack of a mana system feels like it exceptionally limits the amount of things you can do with the game. You can only play one card a turn and it makes it feel incredibly simplistic and like there aren't that many options.

Overall thoughts:

Good game, had a good amount of fun, but it's just lacking some more content and I probably won't be revisiting it until there is some variety to the gameplay.","0","1682565646","true","787","824","0","2","59","0","0","0"

Around 25 runs in 8 hours, reached the boss once, and got steamrolled.
Lovely game, quite easy for my taste.

Edit:
This game is just a little bit difficult. After 16 hours, something like 45 runs, only 3 reaching the boss, I won. Super addictive to the point I wasted a day at work playing this.

Jokes aside though, the main issue with this game is not its difficulty, but the fact you cannot 'choose' the build you want to make, and it's all down to RNG. If I want to do a posion/shroom build, I may get a character and a card that helpes me with that in one area, but every other area may give me cards/companions for other types of builds, then you end up at the boss, with 10 different builds between 20 cards, and 0 synergy, and you have no control over this, outside of the shop, which requires currency, which is limited, and even then, the cards in the shop are chosen at random during every visit.

If they fix some of the balancing on some cards (shroom and bomb builds are super op and way better than anything else, and I don't mean nerfing these 2, but rather buffing everything else),  and also reduce the RNG on companions/shop cards, this has the potential to be a very easy 10/10 for a super fun and addictive game.","0","1682450420","true","467","2655","0","47","0","0","0","1"

People are saying this game is too difficult but it really isn't. I got my first victory on my second run. However, one mistake and it's lights out, which is where I think a lot of the difficulty complaints are coming from. You definitely have to be fully engaged and constantly keep track of the board state, but everything is manageable if you're familiar with this type of game. I do have some minor complaints about the UI, namely no way to turn off the tutorial sun character popups (still trying to remind me of basic mechanics 20 hours in) but overall a very fun and captivating game. For those struggling with the unforgiving nature of the game, it might be worth looking into a limited rewind function, like a bell that rewinds the turn if you die once, maybe refreshing after each boss. Also the pets could use some re-balancing, as snoof is objectively better than all but the last one to be unlocked.

Mostly the fact that mistakes are punished way to harshly in this game, where a single mistake easily leads to a wipe without a chance to recover. The other being just the first choice of your character, where the random nature feels annoying as more than a dozen times two characters are essentially copies of each other but one has more health or attacks more often, making that one objectively better while it might just not work for the deck you wanna play that run since the three factions have their own starting deck and some of their own cards. There is also some cards who are just bad and should almost never be picked.

Despite that I give it a recomendation, it is a fun game and I hope they do something about the champion selection so that it is better. I think this game has some great potential and just needs some time and patches to hammer out details. Id love just making the champion selection better for the player. Like picking your tribe and getting offered 3-5 champions for that tribe with less randomness to them and more premade champions in a pool of choices.","0","1682551375","true","1108","3803","0","34","865","0","0","0"

You are given very limited control over the build you play, and the difficulty ramps are extreme from one area to the next. Its not a game where you go in hoping to win against the odds, but a game where you go in waiting to be ground down by the random and overpowered encounters.

Dont get me wrong it can get frustrating at the start because the difficulty spikes pretty hard early on, but once you get the hang of it.

This game has way too much rng for my liking. There needs to be more options for raising consistency. The three factions you can play with need to be more fleshed out as well. Why is it that I can find Snowdwellers companions when I am playing Shademancers? You have to be extremely lucky to gather the synergies you are going for because there is just an incredible amount of bloat from other classes. It would be the equivalent of finding Defect cards while playing the Silent in Slay the Spire. It also makes each run seem samey and dull. Also only being able to play one card a turn most of the time is just not as fun as a mana system imo.

I think the music and artstyle is great but this game needs to be balanced better with some sort of progression system. It is way too punishing too quickly. Took me around 9 hours to even win my first run and I just barely squeeked by. It felt pretty unsatisfying and I probably won't be playing again unless things are changed.","0.496183186769485474","1682545387","false","548","548","0","18","264","2","0","0"

Simple tips for if you are having trouble:

*Positioning your units is important
*Don't be afraid to sacrifice your heroes for the main hero

RNG plays such a huge role in determining your deck that, in some situations, even with the most calculated of moves and lucky draws, you just die. Some enemy match-up/builds are so overwhelmingly stacked against you that there is literally nothing you can do. And general progression adds more options for your deck, but no central core buffs to make your leader more survivable or make customizing your deck easier. It's a long slog with little pay off that left me asking 'Why am I even playing this game?'.

This leads to dying a lot for silly mistakes and can make even great runs end in a single mistake.

Some might like this but I find it annoying and would love to have some kind of outcome preview before making the move like in other similar games do. At least tell when your move is going to get your MC killed because your action caused a long series of events to unfold and the third enemy in the back row had some counter attack that multiplies only on this turn and is also buffed by the second enemy in the first row because his ally happens to be poisoned still for one turn so that the enemy just happens to deal 6 damage when you calculated that your MC can take 5.

I love graphics and the general gameplay but for the sake of my sanity improve card effect descriptions and add that preview thing that shows the outcome of the next move. Otherwise the end result is just most of the players getting mad instead of having a good time. Also, like other people have mentioned there seem to be only couple of viable builds (DPS or die) so some balancing would be required but I guess that comes with time.

Until the annoyance factor has been fixed I can't recommend this one unless you like suffering or want to spend chess like amount of time making sure that your moves do not have undesired side effects.","0.476190477609634399","1682535451","false","480","816","0","13","0","0","0","0"

Even when you get a fun broken combo you still have to strategize and that's why it's fun. And not to mention the love and care put into the aesthetic, it's gorgeous and adorable. Plus the attention to detail is top notch, some card art will change depending on statistics, like yuki's snowball that grows when her damage grows, and a shade nut enemy that reveals more of it's body once you break it's shell bit by bit...anyway, try this game, it's a blast!","0","1682533746","true","426","1985","0","17","382","0","0","0"

The most 'helpful' negative review with nearly 700 'helpful's is basically the reviewer getting skill issued. No matter how OP the final boss is after you've created them, there is a counter possible and always will be, if not multiple. I've beaten it as well as the many bosses you've faced with enemy buff bells you can get after beating the final boss a few times.

Basically, it's a good tactics game disguising itself as card game.

Also also good soundtrack. Basically there's several songs all with the same beat, but it alters depending on boss entrances/ques as well as what enemy you are facing. If you don't feel something internally resounding when Winter's Wrath plays upon facing The Frost Guardian, I think you're dead inside.

I want to love this game, as I do with almost all card games and roguelite card games.
But all the negative reviews are deserved, imo.

I won't recommend this game to anyone I know except if some things changes.
Why the positive review then ?
This game has a very good potential, and can become something incredibly fun to play.
It has very good basics and the art direction is great.

Where it is way less good is the run design and the balance.

First of all : yes, I think you can win with basically everything.
And yes, it's okayish to win 3 runs in a row for some people.

But overall, someone new to card games will not be able to go far, at all.
There is no easy mode, as far as I can tell. And that's the one thing that is lacking.
I wouldn't play it, but I know most of my friends would, and would enjoy the game that way.
In its current state it would be a frustrating and punishing experience for lots of them.

The run design is very basic, but the fact we have no preview of what bosses we will meet, means that some deck will just get wrecked completely out of nowhere. Some people pointed it out, but that's really a feeling I have too. Yes I had some incredibly good runs. But often I had very good ones and just got obliterated by a hard counter ('teeth' which is a form of counter damage, when you play multi-hit, and ennemies that will wreck your ability to choose your targets, means your leader will gladly kill himself without you having any way to prevent it).

So, preview is lacking.

Choice is also pretty uh... sad.

You can choose among 3 leaders when starting a run, and will get companions which are other characters you can play during a run. They are basically the same, except some leaders are very good, and others are mediocre at best. Some were so bad I was really surprised to see them as leaders. And if you're unlucky, you'll have to choose the less awful one. Sometimes you will also want to build a specific deck around your leader. And... not find any of the cards that go with it. Or only the bad ones. Some cards are very bad, some are way too good. The balance is a mess and if you can make anything work, it will take you a lot of frustrating tries to win with some strategies.

There are a lots of good ideas, but the game is punishing in a very unfair way. Yes it already existed with some ennemies in StS but even there it was manageable. It reminds me more of Roguebook where one elite monster will delete your party if you play a combo deck. But even there you can choose not to try to fight elites in the zone where they are. No, in Wildfrost, you will have to fight that ennemy that will punish you for trying to play certain strategies. Or maybe you won't, and will be lucky, and that will be a good run. That's not a good game design.

Either knowing what you will meet, or having a chance of avoiding the most punishing encounters for playing a certain deck, is necessary with the current balance of the cards. The game is hard, but most of all, it *feels* unfair. You can mock the negative reviews about how the game is hard, but if someone feels that way, feels the game is hopeless and that RNG is way too big of a factor, their feelings are justified and so are the negative reviews. I was sad to see this game I really wanted to play have mixed reviews. I still tried it, and I understand all the negative reviews, and still put a positive one in hope things change. If you care about the community of players who want to play this game and were a vast part of those with an interest in it and yet still put a negative review, then you'll have to adress their frustrations and problems with your game. 

Because if there were enough people that wanted to play this game, that left a negative review so that its overall score was 'mixed', maybe it's not just a fluke, maybe it's not 'angry gamers' and 'entitled kids'. Maybe people wouldn't have to 'get good' to enjoy a game. Yes it can be difficult. Many games have achieved both being difficult and accessible. Many have changed things to improve how new players and people who just want to enjoy different strategies can play and feel rewarded, not punished.

If you don't, then i'll have to side with them, because in the end, their opinions matter as much as anyone else. If not more, honestly. And for me to have a card game I would not recommend is already bad enough (and I have played most of them, even some very obscure ones).","0.503267943859100342","1682516881","true","596","1152","0","19","0","1","0","0"

In my opinion the game have mojor design flaws, it's design as a card game first, and a rogue-lite last, let me explain:
In a card game, you have archetypes that are fundamentaly stronger than certain archetypes and weaker than others, kinda like rock paper scisor, and this game feel like a rigged game of rock papper scisor, where you can only play rock the whole game because pivoting is both way to long/difficult and a waste of ressources, so you better pray that all the fight are scisors or realy realy weak pappers... (and with the sadly low amount of encounters GL pivoting in the first place...)

I'll give a few exemples: build a deck where your main DPS is a multi-hitting unit, get destroyed by enemies that buff themself or damage/debuff you everytime they are hit.
Build a counter-attack team, get destroyed by enemies that hit realy hard.

If you could at least know what fights are ahead, you could maybe prepare a tad bit better, but you can, you have to build your deck and pray that it's good enough to take down a the boss you will face, you're whole progress is in great majority RNG dependant, and SURE, maybe if you played card games your whole life, can strategize 55turns in advance, and still get lucky enough to get the card you need when you need them, maybe, MAYBE, you can reach the final boss semi-consistanly... probably.

A game that advertize 'buid a deck that conrespond you' shouldn't punish you for doing so. 
Telling your player to build a deck up for a challenge, without letting them know in advance what the challenge is, isn't fair, it's a cheap artificial way of giving the impression the game is harder than it is, wich is a shame cause the game is already challenging enough, not knowing in advance what's waiting for you just makes it frustrating when you enter the fight, the boss didn't even showed up and you know you lost already cause your deck isn't build to deal with it.

But if you're into RNG grind until you get THE run, ig this game is for you.","0.478876620531082153","1682507744","false","1281","1341","0","3","166","2","3","0"

The card style combat features little randomness, as opposed to other card games, which makes the combat turns mostly deterministic turning each turn into a little puzzle of sorts(I find this very fun).

Game is not without flaw and it would benefit greatly with some clarity changes: more clear who attacks in what order, how some keywords behave when the row is empty, etc.

Absolutely fantastic game. It's very true that it is utterly unforgiving of mistakes, but this by no means should imply it is overtuned or plagued by bad RNG. You have more thoughtful control of this than most roguelite deckbuilders I've played. 

After enough time spent in Slay the Spire, my friends and I would refer to starting a run as 'pulling the [slot machine] lever' -- a feeling that I personally came to detest. The more I learned about the game, the less control I felt like I had, as I could see the points where things just weren't going to work out. Knowing how much I hated that feeling is what made me wary of the entire genre...

...but that feeling is entirely absent in Wildfrost. The more I learned about the game, the more control I have. I learned to keep track of the waves in combat. I learned to set up consistent combos to generate more bling. I learned what items or followers were the most likely to later benefit from any given synergy, and built more adaptive decks with that. I learned that I would -always- run into at least one boss that hard countered any given archetype, and I learned how to prepare in a way that meant I wasn't relying on my gimmick alone. I learned, over and over.

Of course, these lessons were often received with an audible anguished cry and my hands being thrown up in the air as I shouted the source of my mistake in despair. 'IT HAD GREED,' was one of my recents, as I watched my hero take more damage than I accounted for. 'AIMLESS, AGHHH' is a common one. Or 'SMACKBACK...!' Or -- my personal favorite, said with dawning realization of how much I'd screwed up -- 'oh my god I should not have given Monch hogheaded. Monch please don't do this Monch I mean it Monch why NO MONCH DON'T EAT M-'

But you know? Every single slip up, every single tiny mistake that cost me everything in a run, made me better. This game requires no small amount of focus and skill to play, it's true. Don't let the cute art style fool you. But it's worth it, it's so worth it. For me, the feeling of mastery in this game is stronger than any roguelite deckbuilder I've played.

[/spoiler] Once you are familiar with this, you can expect to have a 20%-50% average win rate

The game currently have diverse deck building strategy, though some of them seems less viable at final boss level, as it depends on getting hit (which is a luxury you cannot afford at that stage), or overly depend on rolling one or two key cards. You might struggle with the mechanics a bit but it should be doable after one or two run. 

Great art overall, though the level beaten animation doesn't really fit the art style. Music is OK. FX is fine tuned and gives you just enough bits of dramatic and adds in the sensation. The UI needs some improvement, e.g. whether charm can be removed, what this weird snail house actually do, and how to remove crown, but overall I can navigate around. The tutorial definitely should NOT force you to do something, especially given the first run doesn't have fixed card draw, so your first fight isn't annoying.

Levels per run is a bit low imo, though not sure whether daily challenge or some modifier bell will change this. This might be intentional (as the enemy and yours stat cannot scale beyond the current final boss), but watch out if you really want something longer. For me I feels we need 1 or 2 more fights after first boss and before final boss, so you get a bit more time to build your deck, and, if you have already finished it, more time to enjoy an OP deck.","0","1681819097","true","158","3784","0","10","0","1","0","0"

I really like this Wildfrost. I think it's got some really interesting and unique mechanics and is absolutely worth a play if you enjoy this type of game.

I'm going to echo another review I read a while back that described this game as a little less deckbuilder and a bit more focused on the strategy. You really have to pay attention to the card text, work out exactly what order actions will play out on any given turn, and figure out the best action to take. The game is hard, but not as much as some reviews might make it seem. I was never anywhere close to beating StS A20, but I managed to barely eke out a win in this game on just my 2nd run (although feeling like I could lose at any moment for the later half of the run). Wildfrost allows you to build and layer card effects and statuses which mesh really well, plus mention the unique way it handles turn order with it's heroes and companions. It really does bring a new original twist to the tactical deckbuilding genre.

I sincerely hope reviews for this game only get more and more positive from here.","0","1682488545","true","99","2619","0","1","0","0","0","0"

It's hard. Really hard.
But there's a nasty little trick hiding in that one word, because about 70% of that difficulty? It's great. Challenging, fun, all the good stuff. 
The other 30%, though? Well, that's a nasty tangle of overbearing RNG, dubious balance, absent QoL features, little inconsistencies, and combinations of all of the above. 
And so while I'm having fun trying to get achievements and win runs, while overall I'll usually have a great time, every once in a while I'll just get screwed over. 
Maybe I got terrible luck with my cards and charms, or maybe I hit an encounter that's just impossible for the deck I got. Maybe I missed a tiny detail and died because I did my mental math wrong, or maybe I played a card and it just didn't work at all how I thought it would. Maybe some awful conflation of events put a nasty buff on an already terrifying enemy and now I have to either die slowly or intentionally kill my hero to restart, since there's no restart button. These things don't happen every run, but they're not uncommon either.

So, while I like the game, and I do recommend it, the negative reviews have a real point. It's not review bombing, there are some real issues. I have faith that they'll be fixed though, the devs seem pretty good so far.","0","1682354481","true","1032","2913","0","48","0","0","0","0"

Wildfrost will test your tactics and your planning like no other deckbuilder I've played before. If you like difficulty and don't mind being punished for mistakes early this game has so so much to offer. The gameplay is so wonderfully unique and deep. 

The way turns flow in this game is wildly different than a lot of other deckbuilders I've played. After Slay The Spire came out having energy and mana dictate how many cards you can play in a turn became really standardized and spread to dozens of similar deckbuilders. Wildfrost implements a system that is completely different and makes every single action a puzzle you have to think about. Every turn becomes a valuable resource and every card an anxious sacrifice of time against the onslaught of overwhelming enemies.

The combat system in the game seems really simple on the surface but has an incredible amount of depth to it. At first it feels like you can just toss out your units and let them duke it out but it quickly becomes apparent that not only are the mechanics of switching your team order and pocketing them for health useful but are paramount to surviving battles.

Wildfrost is a brutal but rewarding game. It took me 13 hours and 20+ runs to get my first win and I felt like I was scrounging for scraps the whole time. Don't get discouraged if you lose a lot of runs, it takes a while to get a feel for the way combat works. Once you get the hang of it everything feels like it falls into place together perfectly.

A lot of fun and innovative mechanics that really elevate this game to feel different from anything in the genre.

I think as it is, it is indeed good enough to recommend at it's current pricing. There's a heck of a lot to like about it. Think of it like a simplified, narrative-light, yet far less forgiving Monster Train. The core gameplay loop is tight and keeps you hooked, strategically the game is very intricate (with a couple of exceptions I'll get to), the presentation is charming and minimalist, and the music is far better than it needs to be. I don't mind the difficulty personally, and I really like that you get offered randomly generated heroes each time, it makes each run feel completely fresh, even if you're running the same clan as last time.

However I found myself getting frustrated at how two mechanics in particular are just straight up run-enders. This only really becomes prevalent after you unlock the first difficulty increase that attaches charms to certain enemies. Teeth is a retaliatory mechanic that simply means any time a character is attacked they recieve an amount of damage back. There is no way to prevent this from happening other than to simply not attack that character, which while often is navigable... it's often not. And when this appears on certain enemies as a charm effect it can sometimes literally be an impossible fight if you have a hero that multi-attacks or has a small health pool. Heck, many of your characters will have 4 or less health, so they will literally one shot themselves if given the chance. I have lost too many runs trying to stave off the inevitable moment where my hero impales themselves on some 15 health enemy with 4 teeth because I literally don't have a way to deal with it. The game gives you two mechanics, Ink and Snow, to manage the abilities of your opponents, but Teeth is exempt from this. There is literally nothing you can do about Teeth. It's at best a tax you have to pay, at worst your run is just over because you haven't had a chance to pick up a chunky heavy hitter. At the very least I would like to see the Teeth charm toned down.

The other mechanic I found myself getting incredibly frustrated with is Aimless. Half of the reason for this is that, well... Teeth exists. Aimless just means the character will attack a random enemy as opposed to what's in front of them. So the game will off you a hero with Aimless and make it look really juicy, with some really tasty stats or effects. You take it and then invariably your run ends the moment your guy bashes some Teeth bearing enemy twice in a row. *Meanwhile* there are enemies with Aimless also and they typically have high health and attack. There have been a fair few runs where I have been unable to stop the Bigfoot or whatever it is getting off the attack, and then it's literally russian roulette as to whether your run ends or not because you made the mistake of picking a 6 health hero and there's a 20% chance they get creamed right now. It just doesn't feel good.

This all comes together in by far the worst encounter in the game which involves two ghosts that give all enemies Teeth and all of your units Aimless. You HAVE to hit the one ghost that's providing the Teeth but he has like 14 health. So you generally have to hit him 3 or 4 times. Oh and if you don't do that in a few turns reinforcements will arrive, thus lowering your chance to hit him and also they gain more Teeth when you hit them in case they didn't have enough Teeth already.  In a game that is very much about planning your own actions and managing your enemies, this is just not fun. The game throws plenty of different challenges and mechanics at you that test you to be able to navigate them while still keeping your delicate machine of a build intact. This encounter is honestly just rolling the dice to see if you're allowed to proceed about half the time.

The last thing I'd say is, It really feels like the mask tribe is definitely weaker than the other two. The base deck is worse (it has no attack scaling in it which can make things difficult, and Tar Blade is often just cluttering up your hand, plus your countdown card damages you), and a lot of their cards don't work well independently. They seem to have the highest power ceiling but you kind of have to get real lucky with what you're offered to actually make them work on the same level as the other factions, I've found.

These are my only major gripes with the game. I've gone into detail about them because I think they're very overbearing in how much sway they have over your run plays out. But the thing is, even when these mechanics were ruining my day, I still felt compelled to click the quick restart button and get right back in with a brand new hero. And I also appreciate that the scope of things is kept small- a run has less than 10 whole combats in it, your deck typically ends up at about 15 cards. Everything in-between combats is swift and simple- pick a card, have a charm, off you go.. The game explains itself very well, though sometimes it can be a bit overbearing to be reminded for the 15th time that you can discard an ally to heal them. I also really like what the game does the first few times you beat a run, without spoiling anything I'll just say it makes for a very interesting way to up the ante whenever you do win.

Overall I like it. I think with a bit of polish in the balance department this could definitely be one of the best deckbuilders out there, filling a niche as a far more minimalist take on the genre (while also being a decent challenge). This a very good game to just sit down and play for half an hour or so without worrying too much about being deeply invested.","0","1682466761","true","7402","7601","0","6","0","0","0","0"

I was somewhere in the middle before refunding. There's a lot to work with here, but after beating two runs while losing a multitude of others, it becomes apparent just how desperately dependent every run is on pure RNG to get some sort of incredible deck synergy that usually starts or ends with whether or not you get a hero at the beginning who isn't complete garbage (and fuck anyone who says otherwise because that's completely disingenuous). And with every run you complete, your dependency on getting even better synergy grows exponentially (I'll not say more).

There's a ton of elements about the game that keep bringing me back to it, but it's not yet deserving of anyone's cold cash at this point in time.","0","1681448500","false","218","231","0","20","0","0","0","0"

Sure you starter leader card thing gets better and better but having cards on field is huge advantage and it up hill battle when the enemy always out numbering and finding proper or broken upgrades to get you far in few due to huge RNG problem. You arent really building decks to make cool combos most time BECUASE YOU ALWAYS PRAYING THAT RNG will give you the card you need for your poison build but you get chili and hearts. LIKE WTF guys adding more and more cards that dont mesh together to the card pool as the game progress just going to wreck people's chances of building a good hand and just becomes a stupid RNG fest. It be great if we can focus on build but ALWAYS PRAYING TO RNG Doesnt help. So how the devs implement roguelike aspect is really hurting this game. If werent for injury mechanic the game be granted easier but sacraficing your companion to take death blow so your leader doesnt die just hurts your run in the long run and getting new companions is all UP TO RNG and even still they that new companion might not even mesh well with your deck.  AND YES I KNOW ABOUT CROWNS in the store to draw cards at the start the round but it cost 80 to buy and low behold RNG if you get shop or not and earning coins to buy the crown can be daunting some rounds considering pulling off 'Combos' is best way to earn it and low behold RNG to pull off combos because you didnt get the cards you need to pull off said combos.

Sorry for Rant, overall my biggest gripe about the game is that it doesn't really feel like a deck building game it more of praying to RNG not screwing you over game. Maybe the DEVs will fix some RNG problems or maybe help allow you to build your own starting deck before going out but who knows. I wouldnt recommend this game until than. I did have fun at the start but the more I realized the game was more about hoping you get good RNG rather than actual strategy just sucks thought going get esiear get father more I play because 'rogulike' aspect but that was beyond the truth so be warn as play longer the starting point just gets harder instead unlike traditional 'roguelikes'","0.474526077508926392","1682457201","false","631","1814","0","2","0","0","0","0"

As of the time I write this, I just got the True Ending and I'm not that good at games, so clearly it can't be THAT hard. More saliently, I think the game's difficulty actually works in its favor. Being so strictly hard removes 'Luck' as a factor, and forces the player into making razor-sharp builds that work in every situation, and stretches your resource usage to the absolute limit every time. At the same time, the game leaves a wide variety of strategies open for each of the three Tribes (classes) so you don't feel forced into any particular strategy. However, some cards are strictly better than others to the point of being auto-takes, and the Final Boss DOES require a more specific strategy to defeat, which is a bit disappointing.

[spoiler]the next boss becomes the deck with which you beat the boss[/spoiler]. The turn system can be a bit difficult to get used to, but once you understand it, it's really great. The game can feel challenging because a simple mistake can make you lose a run. Perhaps an option to rewind just before a move that made you lose would be interesting?

In my opinion, the game is really well-balanced, like most roguelike deckbuilding games, you have to find broken synergies to beat the strong bosses. You have a lot of different options to beat the difficult enemies, and each has a specific counter. The only thing unbalanced is the starting character. Some are a lot stronger than others.

Wildfrost is not only a really interesting and balanced game in terms of mechanics but also one of the most beautiful indie games I've played this year. The game is so polished, with tons of tiny cool animations everywhere. Even for details like a rainbow trail when [spoiler]you recruit the Naked Gnome[/spoiler].

Overall, I would give this game a 10/10 rating. I really don't understand the reviews that say the game is unbalanced and too difficult. Roguelike games are challenging, and this one really nailed it. It's important to keep in mind that this is a rogueLIKE and not a rogueLITE, which is a really good point for me. The game will challenge your skills, and not just your ability to grind for meta progression.","0","1682452793","true","2626","6102","0","5","210","0","0","0"

Nope. Is it frustrating sometimes? Sure. Do I continue playing? 100% yes. There is something very special about this game, otherwise I wouldn't even bother failing and learning. 

But beware: The game is punishing. Not because it is too difficult or something, at least I don't think so. It is punishing because it leaves close to no room for error. Oftentimes, if you make one mistake, miscalculate an enemy attack or have your hero in the wrong position on the battlefield, boom, it's over. For this, you have to be ready.

I for one would love a replay function for the last moves before losing, so I can better learn from my mistakes. Right now, it happens so fast, sometimes it's hard to process what went wrong.

But yeah, great game, aesthetics are up there with the best of them, game feel is ridiculously good, very tactile, if I had to describe it. Give this game a chance!

EDIT: After 15 hours and about 40-50 runs, I finally managed to get a win. There were moments when I thought about quitting because some losses were just so frustrating. But, as I said above, there is something about this game that made me come back every time. For my win I did one specific thing: When I realized I had a competent deck, I went full try-hard mode. I started thinking about every move in detail, sometimes even for minutes. Why? If I learned one thing in my playtime, it is that even with the most overpowered deck one mistake will kill your run. This is brutally frustrating but, as painful as it is to admit, in the end it was always my mistake, not an unfair enemy or a lack of balancing. Therefore, this time I tried my best to not make a mistake again. And yeah, it worked. When Snoof, my hero, delivered the killing blow, it was an amazing feeling. I can't recommend this game enough.","0","1682113525","true","527","1235","0","14","276","0","0","0"

Charming roguelike-deckbuilder in the vein of Slay the Spire. Art and characters are fun and vibrant, soundtrack is a banger.

I haven't been able to clear the game yet so I'm sure there is a skill problem from my side too but idk man I have 800 hours in StS with Ascension 20 cleared on every character so I'm not exactly *new* to roguelike deckbuilders. 

The game clearly has lots of love, the designs, music, metaprogression, card-art, mechanics, etc are absurdly good, but the lack of balancing tears down the whole experience for me. I'd say give the game two or three more months so the devs can polish this and it can turn out into a pretty awesome game, but right now it's not tuned for the casual deckbuilder player.

I've also seen people saying this is not a roguelike deckbuilder but a tactics game, and while what you say is true and I think its first a tactics game then a deckbuilder, the game is marketed as the latter as well as Card Battler, so maybe devs should have stated better what kind of game they're doing x)","0.405648261308670044","1682444033","false","559","1007","0","42","574","3","2","0"

3 hours in (Positive review):
A charming and beautifully crafted world, oozing with love. Wildfrost ain't your typical deck building game. Cards will stay in play (much like Yu-Gi-Oh) for the most part and attack once a counter has reached zero. Their positon can also affect other cards on the board. There's 'spells' to cast, traps to lay, enemies to slow, debuffs to add and buffs to give. This grants a lot of viable strategies, which I really like.

Sadly though, the amount of new cards you get during a run is incredibly low (about 10 cards per run, if you get pretty far) and there's barely any way to remove them. Since you don't get to choose your starting cards as well, RNG will determine most of your deck (RNGesus giveth and he taketh). This is quite sad since there would be tons of combos, if only I could get more chances to aquire cards.

The fights seem to be more like puzzles. If you attack the wrong enemy at the wrong time things can spiral out of control quickly with almost no way to counter it. This makes every play crucial to the run. Combined with the fact that your character is also a card (which is always on the field)  this makes for very interesting bouts. You need to keep your characters HP above zero while also keeping enemy combos in check. This requires a LOT of thought and focus, which I haven't seen in other card games.

7 hours in (Positive review):
Just finished my first run using a spice deck. I had the most dangerous snoof the world has ever seen! So far I'm still enjoying the game a lot. I do understand all the negative reviews though. The game is brutal at times. A single missplay can ruin any good run, which can be quite frustrating. And some encounters are simply impossible with some decks (e.g. boars).
I've added more pros/cons/wishes below.

26 hours in (Positive and final review):
Well I'm hooked. This is the most tactical and interesting cardgame I've ever played. Some fights are still quite unbalanced and too hard to fight with certain decks, but overall it's an amazing experience. It takes quite a while to get into the game though since it plays differently than... well any other game I've played so far.

If you want something different and are looking for a good card/strategy game, this one's it!

Pros:
+ charming graphics, cards and music
+ unique combat system
+ actually challenging
+ tons of different and unique strategies
+ variations between runs (different encounters and bosses)
+ lots of stuff to unlock
+ requires planning ahead and strategy
+ addicting gameplay
+ Snoof

Cons:
- deck building aspect is not adressed enough
- difficulty ramps up way too soon
- game balance (many cards are either too weak or broken. Sadly, most broken cards belong to the enemy lol...)
-game balance (some enemies are a bit too strong)
- RNG heavily determines your run (if you don't get good charms or key pieces to your deck, there's nothing to do really)
- few chances to change starting deck

Things I'd like to see added/changed:
- more chances to add cards/remove cards during a run
- a beginner mode or easier difficulty for first timers (the game could increase in difficulty with each win)
- more synergies between archtypes (shield guys don't match with snow guys and so on... that's a shame)
- more choices to influence starting decks/starting heroes (point system to create characters?)
- maybe make crowns less mandatory? (They are too good to pass up, which makes them a must-buy)
- enemies should not immediatly respawn when you clear the field. Why punish the player?","0.547227025032043457","1681329678","true","193","3925","0","8","0","4","0","1"

[b]Devs:[/b] if you're still reading these, there is definitely a need for a 'balancing patch' to buff certain cards and mechanics.  As it stands, RNGesus is too capricious in the game. The only way to win is to find a gimmick and absolutely bork it with charms and build your entire deck out of it.  It sucks to look at your leader options for a new run and know it probably already lost.

[b]I give the game a solid B to B+ grade as a $10-15 sale in its current state.  If you're a Roguelike Deckbuilder junkie, you'll love it. If the devs can iron out the balance issues, it could be an A+[/b]

The game is MOST similar to Monster Train, though the aesthetics remind me a lot more of Across the Obelisk, and the difficulty curve is more like going Slay the Spire with few unlocks, Ascention 15-20, and only winning beating the heart.  Meta progression is a thing, but it won't save you, the game continues to get harder.  The base difficulty is very high, and the game is extremely punishing for the slightest mistake as the turn unfolds.

But after you learn which cards and mechanics are good-to-absolutely-broken, you get to bully your way through a run.  And the replayability is quite high with the three different tribes, endless RNG.  With some balance to improve viability of other builds, this would be a classic deckbuilder right up there with STS and Monster Train.","0.523809552192687988","1682436693","true","866","1712","0","52","0","1","0","0"

Comparing it to Slay the Spire, it's got way less cards so the runs are more consistent and less focused on strategizing around draw rng. You can easily force archetypes. That said, so far I haven't found any combos that let you cut your brain off like when you get them in StS.

Now is this game hard, yes, I would say on the level of Slay The Spire. So far I've only completed one run. The animations and feel of game play are great, the art is lovely to look at, and the three playable factions feel unique and different. The game just came out and already has daily runs for even more replay ability. Balance could use some work, teeth mechanic is a little too strong, most of the pets aren't worth using, and please, please, please let there be an option to not take a card if all of them are bad.

The game mechanics are pretty unique and interesting. The tribes are awesome, I love the different potential playstyles and builds you can go towards. It's a roguelike, so you have runs and meta-progression that feels great. Even when losing runs it's still a good time. Also - the artstyle and soundtrack are wonderful. This game does a ton right and I hope they keep adding content.

There are some rough edges here and there - there are a few cards I think are just plain bad, one or two deck-types that I can never get to work, certain leaders that are much worse than others, some interactions I can't predict (or they seem buggy). I'm sure they'll iron out some of the issues and polish it up, but overall I think it's already very polished and balanced. I have a feeling other reviewers just don't understand the game well enough or give up on it a little too early. That being said, the game is a bit difficult, at least at the start. I think most good roguelikes start difficult and get easier over time as you unlock things and understand the game more, it's basically how the genre works, idk what people are complaining about.","0","1682403470","true","567","1646","0","10","0","0","0","1"

it punishes mistakes heavily.  RNG can really screw you over.  Encounters seem limited and repetitive when youre getting sent to the starting line over and over, and theres a lot of seemingly 'nothing burger' items and skills, or things otherwise so niche that its hard to plan for having them.

All the positive reviews were, in my opinion, are by people who looked up or used the game's discord to find cheese straits. One of them being the clunker with sneezle and a couple charms to have a turn one advantage which breaks the game completely. This is just one strait but I found many more when I searched up the game on youtube, game's discord, and google.

It was extremely heart breaking to find out because there is no other way to win legit than doing those 'cheese' straits. I have almost 50hours already and I have not beaten the game once without those 'guides'. Also, it really sucks to play this game after beating it because ur old team (u won once with) is now the boss so final boss is most likely going to cheese and destroy u. Which really sucks because u will find urself using more cheese straits to beat ur old cheese deck. And not only that but u don't really feel like u beat the game urself, u just had a easy 'hack' way to win. 
 
If you're the type of person who wants to win without guides or cheesing it you're most likely not going to enjoy this game or even beat it. And if by a miracle u do win once, u'll most likely never win again without deleting your save file and restarting because ur old deck will be the boss with amp'd stats.

What I will tell you is what it FEELS like playing Wildfrost as someone who is at best average at deckbuilder roguelikes.

It starts out easy. Then the difficulty spikes in the second act. The game will throw a lot of challenges at you which you might not be prepared for due to the limited number of cards/companions you can add to your deck.  It feels like there are too many things out of your control. Chose a hero with Aimless? You better just hope they don't attack that enemy with a 15-stack of Teeth. Sometimes it feels like you end up in a situation that you simply can't recover from no matter how long you stare at the screen, and you'll have no idea how you even wound up there.

For these reasons I cannot recommend Wildfrost.

I imagine there are some easy balance fixes that could change my opinion though. Simply giving you a preview of the enemies in the upcoming battle will go a long way to helping smooth out the difficulty curve. Stop heroes from getting rolled with the Aimless trait--it's simply too annoying to have to micromanage them with Snow. Give us the option to maybe skip picking up a card when all three choices suck.

Credit where credit's due: the art and animation is spectacular--honestly one of the main reasons I bought this game. And props to the devs for trying a new formula in the quickly overflowing roguelike deckbuilder genre. I just wish the game were just a little bit more forgiving.","0.482954531908035278","1682399505","false","355","1159","0","28","0","0","0","0"

I enjoyed playing it and it was fun to use the different available strategies. A few things I don't like: tar blades aren't as good as the scrappy swords or the hammers that the Clunker deck uses and this makes it harder to win with them. Scrappy swords can be removed with two trips to the muncher while tar blades would take three for the 5 you start with. The hammers that the Clunkers use scale in damage so they work pretty well in a small deck where you can cycle them quickly. Also, tar blades do not do consistent damage because the damage is based on how many are in your hand. Also if you have 4/6 cards in your hand and 4 of them are tar blades, you're not going to be able to snow the enemy/ have a blocker card/ get your next companion that you need out. They either clutter your hand or they do no damage depending on how many cards are in your deck . I do love this game though that's just my one complaint. Also a challenging game, I have won once with 18.6 hours played so far.

The game is difficult, but the difficulty itself isn't the problem. Wildfrost rarely gives the player the tools needed to overcome its difficulty and suffers from a lack of information and little control over deck creation. To get it out of the way, the animation, art, and sound design are superb and legitimately game-of-the-year worthy. The attention to details in the art design mirrors Hades at times. It's that good... but the gameplay loop has flaws that sink the title for me and I can't recommend Wildfrost to either fans of the genre or anyone casually interested.

Lack of Information:
Most of the boss fights hard-counter at least one mechanic that you might use in your deck: Fast-moving units counter complicated setups, unit swarms counter strong single-target attackers, Barrage counters backline supports, poison counters everything, etc. This is fine, but Wildfrost's frustrations stem from the lack of information provided ahead of time to anticipate upcoming challenges and build accordingly. Where in Monster Train and Slay the Spire you get a preview of the zone boss to encourage adaptation, you're going to lose many boss fights in Wildfrost because you walk into a fight only to find out RNG gave you the spike boss that counters your carefully-crafted multi-hit pepper combo, and without it, you don't have the tools to out-damage the boss. You're going to lose this way many times, and it never feels good.

A slightly smaller problem, but Wildfrost also doesn't let you see beyond the next boss battle, meaning that just as you can't adapt to the enemies you'll face, you're also not given the ability to adapt to the resources you'll be given. You might skip the unit card path to instead pick up a charm, only to find out after the boss that there are no units available on the next route. This won't affect everyone, but it eliminates the feelings of carefully planning an approach or gambling on certain artifact/card drops that MT and StS require on higher difficulties.

Little Control on Deckbuilding:
The problems above can be easily fixed with some changes to the display of information, and I think the game would benefit from it. While the lack of information might be a quick fix, Wildfrost's approach to deckbuilding is where I feel the game really starts to melt down. 

In Wildfrost, the faction cards remain consistent game-to-game, but the base hero selection for each run changes with variations that lean towards certain synergies. The hero selection pushes you towards looking for other cards that can create effective combo packages, such as strengthening a multi-hit hero, or creating 'junk' for a tool-based hero. While they can sometimes feel unevenly balanced, they nicely support experimentation to try the different variations. It's a personal preference, but I feel that the random hero generation experiment that Wildfrost attempts here isn't as satisfying as the faction and hero upgrade system in Monster Train, but I think this is a personal preference.

Since the hero is the lose-condition on each battle (who cannot retreat), you're somewhat forced into focusing on the hero's strengths and building to compensate for its weaknesses, since a poorly-used hero is a liability on the small battlefield. You might get carried by a strong unit or spell, but if your hero dies, your run is over. While you can draft bigger/rarer spells and units, your hero doesn't change stats, so there are some heroes whose abilities just don't remain useful into the late stages of a run. This context is important to understand why the deckbuilding in this game doesn't feel nearly as satisfying as the games it draws inspiration from.

There is a large pool of status types and card effects, some faction-specific and some universal, but in order to make the best use of your faction leader variation, you'll need to spend the first 2-3 card selection opportunities looking for cards that fall in sync with the leader you've chosen before the first major difficulty check arrives. You can't afford to figure out a build later, because once the first difficulty spike arrives, you've only had 2 encounters and 4-6 card selections to build your deck.

Because of the speed in which Wildfrost asks you to 'figure it out,' my decks often feel very unfocused, with 2-3 cards that are absolutely vital to my success and 5-10 sub-optimal ones that I had to pick up along the way. Because there are so many variations that don't always play well together, very rarely are you choosing between 3 cards that can make an impact in your deck. There's no way to anticipate upcoming events, paths, and rewards, and the pool of cards is so large for each faction, so it's incredibly risky to grab a card that introduces a new mechanic to the deck because there's no way to increase the odds of getting a compatible synergy. The bosses, as they are balanced now, punish you with an end to your run for taking the risk of pivoting or experimenting outside of the build archetype you've already started to build.

All in all, there's a few mechanics here that just don't feel cohesive and create a frustrating deckbuilding experience:
1. There is no skipping card selection, and there is a (very-cute) removal station that will appear at the opportunity cost of another card-selection station (An option to remove in the shop would help to fix this). This makes it difficult to trim and focus decks.
2. The different sub-builds within the three factions (think Slay the Spire's Ironclad building Strength, or Defense, or Anger) don't work that well together, and as a result, each 3-card decision feels muddy, like there's too many cards in the pool that just don't work with what you're trying to do at any given point. I feel like because of this, I often end with unfocused decks or revert to a middle-ground where the same decisions play out run after run.
3. The game forgoes a mana system in favor of a one-card turn, which means that as you pick up stronger cards, the starting cards are costing the same as your best cards, which feels absolutely horrible since it's difficult to pull them out of your deck. This can be fixed a little bit with the Charm system, which lets you add modifiers to cards, but they're expensive enough and random -- you may spend a very large amount of resources on a charm that has no impact at all.
5. Wildfrost's planning phases lack randomized events to introduce risk/reward decisions, and so there's very little game-to-game variety in the way you approach deckbuilding. The lack of these further adds to the feeling that Wildfrost never really lets you cut loose with a weird idea, a unique toy to build around, or something that you're stretching to make work. The problems presented don't require creative solutions, they require a meticulous attention to every detail of the enemy's moves, and even the good runs feel more owed to survival than a clever solution.

For the artists' sake, I hope this game gets enough attention that the devs return to the design and make some adjustments, but in the current state I feel fans of deckbuilders and strategy games should keep looking.","0.486739784479141235","1682383771","false","509","602","0","7","243","17","1","1"

You need to have a very deep grasp of roguelike card battling games (such as Monster Train, Slay The Spire or Across The Obelisk) to get a campaign victory -- this is what caused a lot of negative reviews.

The balance is quite decent at release, things can be tweaked slightly and perhaps a journalist friendly easy mode could be looked into (only got my first victory, without the 'true ending' at 17 hours).. But don't expect patches to go very fast because it is developed by only a team of only two people.

You can be a little nut guy who gets stronger the more nut points you give him. The only problem is; when you get hurt, your nut coating begins to break down. The little nut guy is made out of nut but where does the extra nut come from? My assumption is that it's the dead skin of the little nut guy's dead comrades. He picks up the hollowed, rattling carcass of his friends and gets inside, letting blows from yetis, snowmen, and gnomes bounce off of their souless bodies, void of the winds of life.

There are a lot of unlockable cards and charms to unlock!

So far, with just 2,5 hours played all I can say is:

- The art and music in this game are 50 steps above any other game from this genre. It's just a delight to be in the game, even if you are losing or whatever. Just existing inside the world of Wildfrost is a delight to the senses.

- The game is tough but definitely not impossible and so far it hasn't felt unfair. The thing is you really need to pay attention to what you are doing and be methodical. If you are trying to speedrun this game while still learning, you WILL make a mistake and probably lose.

-I really appreciate that it is equally important to make a good deck AND know how to pilot it. Encounters are long and difficult, some times they feel like a battle of attrition, but that gives your deck more time to shine and you will only win fights if you truly crafted a good enough deck. No freebies just because you drew some insane bombastic turn 1 80 damage combo like you sometimes do in Slay the Spire.

Game has it's faults (I think it needs a better/more expanded tutorial, and visual clarity could be improved) but it is awesome so far. Deserves at least 85% positive IMO.

EDIT: I have now reached the true ending of the game, at 17 hours of playtime. What I have learned over this time is:

-I really love the game. I think I had more fun in these 17 hours than in my 100 hours of Slay the Spire lol

-The people who are complaining about the balance and the difficulty are terrible at the game. I feel like it is fairly easy to reach the true ending. (Far easier than Slay the Spire A20 for example)

-I would actually say that the biggest negative of the game is that the difficulty scaling ends too soon. There are only 3 difficulty modifiers ('Bells') that you unlock, and once you beat the game with those 3 modifiers enabled, that's kinda it. You won. The game doesn't get any harder. I still have some items, companions, achievements, charms and other stuff to unlock, but I can't do those while I work on 'ascending' anymore. Compare this to Slay the Spire, where you have 20 ascension levels PER CHARACTER....this game needs more content IMO.

So yeah, overall an incredible game well worth your time. Recommended!","0.547325074672698975","1681937337","true","148","1027","0","30","779","2","0","0"

Unlike other reviewers, I never felt like the game was particularly unfair to me.

Most of my deaths were due to misplays from missing an optimal move to forgetting a foe has a particular skill or thorns or aimless.

My only complaints are that there are fairly limited pools of options, and your hero being semi randomised at the start doesn't feel quite right to me.

From someone who loved Slay the Spire, but didn't enjoy Across the Obelisk, I can say that Wildfrost is the best of both worlds.

Across the Obelisk is more an RPG than a card game (cards are boring). 
Wildfrost has very interesting cards with engaging effects, like in StS.
Of course StS still has, in my opinion, the best mechanics. (Cards being tied to a character brings something fresh and unique to each character. Almost feels like a new game for each character.)

While Wildfrost does not have that kind of feature, it brings a lot more that makes the game feel different than the others.

If you like single-player card games, you must try it!

Also wanted to briefly meniton the length - I think it's perfect.  A lot of similar games drag on for too long and leave me not wanting to even start a run as it will take forever.  Moving between map events is smooth and fast, it doesn't feel like a slog at all.  A run probably takes around 45m-1hr?  I'll be honest though I was not timing so I could be off here.

Wildfrost is [i]fantastic[/i]! By far the most polished game in its genre when it comes to basically everything except balancing (nothing beats Slay the Spire in this, of course), and even the balancing I think is remarkably good; it's just that the game's tactics-driven, position-centered gameplay means it's relatively easy for single mistakes to have big repercussions. This is, in fact, a great thing, because it means that your gameplay decisions really, really matter; each turn of every battle is a nail-biting adventure, the joyful tension stretched to a brilliant extreme. Wildfrost is filled to the brim with wonderful and surprising mechanics, offers good variety, and will likely prove just as endlessly playable as the best in this genre, are. I've only won four times in my 15 hours, but it's been an absolute blast, and at hour 15 I'm even more excited to play more and improve my play than I was at hour 0. I hope prospective players will understand: this genre isn't played so you can win; it's played because every small decision you're offered is a sublime dilemma. Difficult choices lie at the heart of good videogame design; by this metric, Wildfrost knocks it [b]far[/b] out of the park.

The game's not perfect; there are a few small flaws here and there, like non-obvious interactions of various mechanics that I couldn't predict for certain before I tried them, or card upgrades that don't clearly differentiate between e.g. 'decrease strength by 1' (which decreases the card's strength) and 'apply [decrease strength by 1]' (which might have decreased the card's target's strength by 1). It'd be nice if these minor things got fixed, but honestly, as a player you'll make these mistakes once, maybe lose a run or two because of them, and then in the future you'll know. If the game receives zero patches, I'd still be incredibly happy with it.

Don't overlook Wildfrost; it's a top-tier roguelike deckbuilder that more than deserves your attention and your love. Any fan of the genre owes it to themselves to check it out.","0","1682343292","true","924","1760","0","1","264","1","0","0"

You most likely WILL NOT being winning right out the gate unless you have seen this played and are a GOD with RNG and strategy. The RNG is brutal and if you miss one little keyword, you will die. If you mess up a turn late in the run, you will most likely die. If you are looking for a game where you just want to win a bit and head to bed, don't get this game.

Yes, the game is very hard and demands a very careful thought process about how to go about a turn. However, You cannot play this like Slay the Spire and just toss cards willy-nilly until you've won. You need to stop and read every single card and think about it can be useful to your current build. You also NEED to take in account of what the enemies do, and REMEMBER THAT THEY MOVE FIRST UNLESS IF YOU REDUCE A COUNTER TO ZERO FIRST. I love the art and music and once you understand how the game is meant to be played, it's an extremely fun deckbuilder that's come out this year. I'm sure there will be balance patches after this review, but the game is beatable in it's current state.

But, if you played the game just for that, you're in for a surprise. And if you play this game thinking it's just like Slay the Spire, you will [i]also[/i] be in for a surprise.

Make no mistake, this game is quite difficult, and certainly deserves that user-defined tag. That said, I do think the cries of imbalance are unwarranted. Being no stranger to difficult games, especially Roguelikes and Roguelike Deckbuilders, I think the source of the game's difficulty is that it's also a [b]tactics[/b] game. Many people will come in expecting a relatively easy time if they've played Slay the Spire before, especially with the unassuming artstyle, but to their surprise, there's much more to the strategy than just building a deck for further encounters. There's also board positioning (yours and the opponent's), turn order, unit management, optimizing combos for more gold, AND (small spoiler) [spoiler]ensuring your run isn't so powerful that it'll brick your subsequent runs[/spoiler]. And this is just for challenges specific to Wildfrost. Because it's part of the roguelike deckbuilder genre, expect to see the same challenges of scaling, prepping for specific encounters, knowing when to greed, deck trimming, etc. If you have no experience in either of the two main genres, you will likely struggle. If you have experience in only one, there's still a learning curve to look forward to.

My experience in this game was actually quite smooth - beat the game with the tutorial run (granted I watched like ~5 hours of gameplay before deciding to get it), and beat the true ending the same night I bought the game. Although watching some gameplay did help me get over the learning curve quickly, I think having played games like Slay the Spire, Into the Breach, XCOM, Inscryption, and Griftlands enabled me to conquer the game relatively quickly. Into the Breach is a big one, since it essentially checks off all the boxes I listed regarding the scope of the game's board tactics. Plus, this also meant I was familiar with taking 5+ minutes on single turns and half as long when deciding card rewards.

Aside from my experience with the game's difficulty, I didn't really encounter any bugs in the game and had no hiccups on performance. Content-wise, I am left wanting more, but I understand a game with so many moving parts takes a lot of fine-tuning to balance.

Certainly looking forward to whatever is in store for this game's future. I actually hope that the devs don't cave-in to the criticisms of balance, I personally think the game is immensely well balanced given how complex it can get. Highly recommend if you're into both tactics games and roguelike deckbuilders, and still recommend if you're only used to one of these genres.","0.523809552192687988","1682303284","true","1705","2272","0","10","102","1","0","2"

I like the combination of heroes and different abilities that the game lets you mix and match between with charms adding an additional layer of depth to your runs.

Short for a roguelite, but was enjoyable every step of the way.

The unique artstyle and animations is what really separates this game from Slay the Spire and Monster Train, similar roguelite deckbuilders. This game has a bigger focus and allies and charms rather than cards. I will very rarely decide to take a route with more cards than charms/gold/allies.

The gameplay is short and sweet. It doesn't have the 'grindy' feel of slay the spire and each tribe has a very unique way of playing the game. At times, the gameplay can feel a little unbalanced. Certain builds will propel you to the final boss without much effort, while others feel like a fruitless and longer grind game which ultimately end up nowhere.

Regardless, I cannot wait for a new update for something like a new tribe or new final boss. Overall, if you like games like Slay the Spire and Monster Train, you will love this game.","0","1682292061","true","2677","2739","0","23","148","0","0","0"

Going in with an understanding of the mechanics, managed to beat the game on my 2nd and 4th runs. The difficulty is not nail-bitingly impossible if you're used to games like Monster Train.

Without seeing a few attempted runs prior to playing, I could definitely see my first impressions being worse, likely failing my first few runs learning the intricacies the game doesn't cover during your initial run. Tempo is extremely important, play the reinforcement timer to your advantage, exploit enemy weaknesses and prioritise or hinder enemies your team can't handle.

Fun soundtrack, fun visuals, engaging game play if you enjoy micromanaging your positioning each turn to maximise gains for your strategy. It's certainly not for everyone, I'm an attentive person and still made plenty of mistakes, it depends on whether you blame yourself or the game when these mistakes happen.

Not many games have me play them for 7.3 hours the day I bought them, I still want to play more and discover this elusive true ending. Still tonnes of stuff to unlock so can mess with all new sorts of strategies.","0","1682290199","true","439","2203","0","5","423","0","0","0"

The game it reminds me of most strongly is Into the Breach. Basically, no matter how strong your deck is, you could lose at any moment by not paying close attention to what is going to happen in the turn. 

Unlike ITB, however, the game won't tell you if your turn will kill you. You've just got to figure it out for yourself, which can cause a lot of death. 

There's a lot of stuff to decide upon each turn, and there's a lot of room for optimization there as well. For instance, it's a lot more valuable to kill lots of enemies at a time, so it's occasionally worth freezing your own characters to prevent them from prematurely killing enemies. 

The strategy of the deckbuilding itself is subtle. You will not get that many opportunities to really change your deck so you won't be able to pick a target build-type to try to win the same way every game, This is a good thing, but also makes the game harder. None of the cards feel overpowered, with perhaps one exception (B.I.N.K solves everything), and while there are cards I tend to completely ignore, I suspect that this is to my detriment, rather than it being because they're just bad. 

Having played the game, it clearly doesn't deserve to be at 71% positive reviews, so I'm adding my +1. The game is *extremely* well balanced. You've got to be willing to experiment to see what will work, and you've got to make every decision critically.","0","1682289471","true","1955","7745","0","7","0","0","0","0"

I've been finding myself still playing through the game despite already beating the final final boss, which is a mark of a good roguelike.

It's aesthetics speaks for itself, the art is amazing and all the pets are very cute. I also really enjoy some of the game design components, particularly the combo and charm system. The combo system really incentives a unique level of control over the battle so that you can maximize your gold, at the cost of having to balance some extra risk. The charm system has you nicely consider what each of your cards is good at and can also lead to some truly disgusting charm combos. I've been finding myself even hoarding my charms until I have the cards/charms to set up something good.

I have also given the difficulty a lot of thought. It's not an overly difficult game in terms of the enemies you have to beat. While the final final boss is HARD, the game gives you the opportunity to get strong enough to beat it. I think someone who is really good at the game could probably beat every run. Where I think a lot of the difficulty comes from is how easy it is to make mistakes in the game. From not paying attention to an extra charm to an enemy, or accidentally attacking an enemy with smack-back, it is really punishing on mistakes. If you get to into the combo system (like me), it's very easy to take too much chip damage and lose control over the fight. These losses can be very frustrating to someone who isn't used to roguelikes, but I believe the devs are aware of and addressing these concerns.

Finally, it is kind of limited in terms of what to do after you've beaten the game. It does have well incorporated achievements which can be fun to play towards. But it does lack things like an ascension system that could actually increase enemy difficulty with each run. It's 'boss relic' is limited to only three choices, which do get repetitive and boring over time as well.","0","1682282731","true","2294","3185","0","5","0","1","0","0"

My thoughts about the game evolved a lot, and I think there's one that really stands out:

This game needs a system to indicate which characters are going to die if the turn ends in its current state. Monster Train does this with a little red x, and the indicator updates as players 'mouse over' a particular play they're considering making. A red x (or question mark when there's some RNG, eg Aimless) would bring this to GOTY, lifelong addiction territory for me.

One card play in this game isn't just going to resolve that one effect. There are up to 12 cards on the battlefield that are passively counting down and resolving too, and their interactions can cause more effects to trigger. And the game design doesn't really permit lapse in judgement; your run will likely end immediately if you overlook one of the many details happening simultaneously.

Many of my losses felt 'fair' but brutal. Fair, because I knew a detail could end up run, probably thought of it very recently, but forgot about it long enough to end my turn and kill my hero. I like the design that one mistake could end the run at any time, but the UI should support that design by helping us see what mistakes we're making in a busy card field.

I have my win streak and hard mode boss kills. I want to play this game every day but really don't think I will if it requires that level of vigilance. It's such a fun killer to have a great run going, make the tiniest misplay and instantly throw the whole thing, and makes game play feel like a bit of work.","0","1682281417","true","2329","2395","0","4","192","0","0","0"

One mistake can cost a run, but that mistake is often foreshadowed many turns in advance. There are many paths to victory besides the obvious synergy. For example, I had one run carried by a smackback unit paired with a totem that applies a double damage debuff after an enemy attacks. 

When it comes to game balance I feel like the starter deck is most consistently powerful as snow is amazing and pairs into any deck type. The summoner tribe is the deck I've had the most fun with and has some really cool archetypes, while the Gnomes feels under-powered compared to the other two. Junk is a cool idea for a mechanic (think wounds from STS but as a resource) but often ends up clogging your deck without many ways to use it, or the exact opposite.

I have played Slay the Spire, Trials of Fire, and Monster Train, and this game adds enough twists on the genre to have its own place among the crowd. What I particularly like about this one is that it feels much more like a puzzle. You will frequently have turns where you re-arrange your units and evaluate card order for long periods of time, which is a plus for me. I have begun to really enjoy strategy puzzle hybrids. Some people have apparently complained about difficulty. Is it a hard game? Sure, I would say so being an average strategy game player. But in my opinion it is a perfect level of challenge. It also means you get more bang for your buck. You will spend more hours in the learning curve, and play the game longer. But I do understand if that pushes some people away. 

Features I really enjoy.
- The charm system. Charms are fun modifiers you can add to cards. Not a new concept to deck building games but Wildfrost implements it so smoothly. When you acquire charms you can save them for later, which allows you to efficiently stack them on the best cards. The aesthetics of both the charms and how they equip to cards is pleasant.
-  The countdown system. Your units on the battlefield have a countdown timer, which at the end of the timer will execute their attack/action. This is what gives the game such a puzzly feel combined with unit placement and attack order. It makes the game have more depth then something like Monster Trains combat system.
- Spoiler Alert! : [spoiler] The corruption mechanism: At the end of a successful run your units and leader will be boosted in strength and become the next boss battle you face at the end of your next run. I think this is an amazing idea! It not only causes you some emotional distress to fight your own successful teams, but forces you to switch up your strategies. [/spoiler]
- The countdown bell: A bell on the right side of the screen will countdown by 1 every time you play a card until it reaches 0. When it hits 0, you can click it to draw a new hand of cards for free. Clicking it when its not 0 will still draw a hand of new cards but cost you a turn. Really fun dynamic to cause you to think about timing and card priority. 
- The art style. Fantastic. I enjoy a variety of visual styles and this is one of them. Makes for really fun character profiles. 
- Runs very well. The game runs smoothly and doesn't require a massive amount of computer resources. Good for laptop users or potato computers. 
- UI is designed by a genius. Some ability/card interactions you will have to science for yourself, but a lot of info is displayed for you. 

Things I would like to see in the future:
- More factions. MORE FACTIONS. MORE CONTENT. 
- More Enemy variety and bosses. Again, more content. The enemy's already in the game are amazing.
- Additional game modes? More content?
- Have I said more content? Only cause this game is amazing. 

Things I didn't like:
- I thought almost all of the companions I have encountered have had a use/strategy. Hazeblazer felt pretty useless or hard to get rolling. He has low hp, low attack, a high counter, steals hp from ALL ALLIES, and only applies 1 haze. Even with upgrades he feels like a bad investment compared to other units. 
- Snow builds feel a little under powered. Or at least investing into snow at all, even if it isn't your primary focus. At least with the cards and charms I know exist. I think that's primarily because of units with the snow shield passive. The enemy units you need snow to stack, are protected from it. 
- When the game starts getting good, it ends. Most run based games I feel like are the perfect length. This one feels a tad short. Just when I get my strategy online, I'm fighting the final boss. 

Overall, 5/5. I'm glad I got it even though when I did it had a mixed review. I guess the game attracted an audience not suited for what it's going for? If you like strategy and/or puzzle, pick up this gem. 

P.S. Developers, if you are going to mess with difficulty, I would suggest not tweaking it too much. For me the game feels like its at a relatively good place.","0","1682278514","true","1078","2315","0","33","409","0","0","0"

An amazing mix of great design, excellent execution, and one of the best art styles I've ever seen.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
+ Basics are very clear to understand but there are many deep and complex interaction and actions to take.
+ rearranging your companions and recalling them being free actions adds so much depth to all fights 
+ Many interesting deckbuilding synergies and  combos are possible* (caveats below)
+ Amazing artstyle.
+ Hilarious theming combos of art + names.
+ Great music.
+ A nice thematic surprise awaits when defeating the final stage* (caveats spoilered below)
+ All interactions feels crafted and polished to perfection with amazing feedback and juice
+ Many QoL polish features that other games take for granted
+ good controller support (options for alternate button glyphs for PS controllers would be nice)
+ steam cloud sync saves
+ sane install size

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
- daily challenge being fixed seed unfairly benefits people who wait till late in the day and watch the results of other people doing the challenge, e.g. this item available here, that companion available there, they can then minmax OP synergies.


[hr][/hr]
The only other gamewide issue I can think of balancing feels somewhat off, many other reviews cite this, but dont really elaborate so I will share things that I've thought about while playing.

[h1]Cons 2: balance boogaloo[/h1]
- The face value of many cards is low, but the last stages seem to be balanced to be unwinnable without having some good luck in forging OP synergies.
- OP Synergies are a definite potential, but the deckbuilding  limitations during each stages makes those quite rare.
- RNG of spawning particular events along between fights curbs forwards planning: e.g. as the clunkmasters / Snowdwellers it is almost always a detriment to keep all the starting copies of scrappy sword or gearhammer, but the ability to remove / add consume  to  them is very down to chance, and I've seen nothing that would synergise with keeping all the copies. 
- Picking certain offered companions early is a roll of the dice to whether you get charms or support companions to enable them to be good. This plays off the above point that many cards are not good enough to be used past early stages by default, but very quickly become extremely powerful if any only if combined with very specific things.
- All the above combined sums up to there being far too many stars that need to align to survive to the end, let alone beat the final stages. Other games in the genre offer a bit more generosity in the levers available to tip the RNG of deckbuilding in your favour, AND have way less moving parts in a battle to reduce the number of deaths to player mistakes. The moving parts add a lot of enjoyable tactics to each battle, but the RNG of deckbuilding being slightly too miserly compounds the difficulty here to be a bit too much. 
- Spoilers for after winning the last stage [spoiler] Your winning party replacing the previous boss is a very cool idea, however depending on the makeup of that winning combo you might be making your future playthroughs miserable. It seems that only companions cards are kept in the boss fight and not items, this means that winning with a team that heavily leans on item cards for power leaves a weaker bossfight to take on next time, but if you win with companions that have a lot of inherent power from charms you are dooming yourself to extremely hard future bosses. This also spoils some deckbuilding and planning, disincentivising winning by having a strong hero or companions. [/spoiler]


[hr][/hr]
This game is still amazing despite all the balancing feedback and deserves to be recommended. The balancing is something that I think is very fixable with tweaks to the stages, such as the number of inbetween fight stops, what those things offer to you, shop stock and other event related things.

First and foremost, this game is fun. If you like deckbuilders in this genre, most likely you will enjoy this game. There are a solid amount of mechanics, with many of them interacting in interesting ways allowing for some really fun combos. The meta-progression of the town adds more diversity to your runs, but doesn't feel like something you need to grind out to get an advantage. 

I find the comments describing the game as too difficult or unbalanced, totally unfounded and I think people just didn't give it long enough for the game to click. I would describe myself as a very average skill player and it took me maybe 8hrs to beat my first run, and I was able to make it to the final boss in both the following runs. The game does feel very punishing at first because misreading a single turn can lead directly to a loss, but once you start to learn how all the different systems work you can use them to your advantage.  I really hope the devs do not make the game 'easier' for the sake of a vocal minority. Instead I would like to see more enemy and boss diversity added to the game.

Overall, if you like the kind of game, do yourself a favor and check it out.","0","1682271089","true","577","982","0","1","252","0","0","0"

Most hard games generally have either bad art or a more gritty dark artstyle, so i think many got into the game expecting a very forgiving game because the art is cute and they got upset about the difficulty.

The game is hard but very fun and addicting, even if you don't win the run it's fun to try making a certain build work.

As a card game you have to keep in mind this is not a deckbuilding game where you just pick the best 'overall' cards and win by having a deck with a lot of good statted cards and some sinergy.
You need to combo and you need to combo hard if you want to win.
If something looks broken you should absolutely use it without remorse. because your next boss could be a 500 attack monkey and your average unit health is 6.
The game knows you can come up with some really broken builds so it won't pull any punches.

Something that makes the replayabilty very high is the fact you are not playing a fixed class but instead you are trying to put together a certain combo build, and they vary a lot.
Freezing enemies in place, retaliate damage, sacrifice, poison stacking, ecc..
these are not just mechanics you can and should make an entire deck around them.

Gameplay wise the game feels very fresh to play with the absence of resources needed for playing cards.
Every card can just be played for free but doing so advances one turn and every unit on the board has a countdown of turns before they attack.
This creates a really interesting gameplay where you need to really think about what you want to play, because every card you play needs to matter. If you want to put down one more unit it better be worth it because you just made every enemy unit closer to attacking.

The game got rid of all trash fights, meaning every fight in the game is a bossfight. So you either making choices on how to build the deck or fighting a boss.
This works really well with the combo/sinergy nature of the game.
Every decision matters a lot. what you put in the deck, every card you play and every single fight.

The charm system is really good, it allows you to modify cards creating very insane broken combinations.
And the crown sistem allows you to set up your sinergy more easily at the start of a fight.

TLDR: 
Wildfrost is one of the best roguelike deckbuilding games.
Don't be fooled by the arstyle this is 'the dark souls of' card games (lol) but if you understand how it wants to be played you will find a paradise of deckbuilding possibilities.","0.52173912525177002","1682266558","true","1061","2532","0","1","0","3","0","0"

What this game suffers from can easily be updated and balanced, which I hope it does. I've read the reviews and comments and there are people on both sides sayings its a skill issue, and that its unbalanced and too difficult as a result.

Ive played other roguelike deckbuilder games and I like these type of games. I am not new to the genre. At first I thought sure, it must be a skill issue. So I played more and got well versed into the tactics and how the game works. But then you realize that it's mostly RNG and you really need good synergy to get far in the game. If RNG doesn't grant you the cards to build that synergy, your run will be done early. That's most of the attempts. It's like pulling a slot machine at the casino, just hoping you get a good starting leader with cards to support it.

The game's items (charms and crowns) do not do enough to help you in your run, or to tip things into your favour (it can, but as mentioned above, its RNG - if you manage to get that nice synergy combined with getting good charms to match).

At this point I am bored, it's repetitive, and I dont want to keep pulling the slot machine hoping for a good build/run.","0.51454460620880127","1682260539","false","414","640","0","25","372","7","0","0"

It's a turn-based tactics game with deckbuilding elements that reminded me of an energy-less version of Monster Train. My main gripe was that I found combat resolution tedious to parse.

I think it would help to have a clean damage prediction overlay that does all of that work for you.

I ended up refunding, because I wasn't convinced I'd get value out of my purchase. I would reconsider the title on a sale, especially if there are some UI improvements.","0.444703996181488037","1682244224","false","96","96","0","17","0","0","1","0"

If you’re looking for another review talking about balance, I’ll say it first - It is much less forgiving than games like Slay the Spire and Monster Train or other similar roguelike card battlers. (Considering the default difficulty and not at the harder ones). Beyond that, this game is one of my favourites coming out of 2023; I genuinely adore it to bits and will probably be playing many more runs of it even after getting the true ending.

[h1]Beautiful art, from characters to the buttery smooth UI[/h1]

I think the strongest positive that Wildfrost has going on for itself is the presentation. The card art is detailed, charming, and very functional. A weak sword serves as your first measure of what gives damage, a character with a large mallet does more damage, and a box with teeth reflects damage. It’s nothing short of stellar and it’s definitely some of my favourite art from a card game. 

What really impresses me, however, is how smooth the user experience is. The transitioning between the menus, the feedback from using cards or selecting different items in the shop, to even the more minute interactions like zooming into a card to see what it does and getting information on how some enemies work. 

Many times, indie games have a solid core and a rough exterior, but Wildfrost is as polished as they come.

[h1]Complex battles that only get more rewarding when you get pass the difficulty curve[/h1]

The battles in Wildfrost can really come down to the wire if your deck isn’t broken. I’ve had multiple fights where I have to kill the boss to win, and i’ll be literally a turn away from death. It’s exciting and it’s very much a numbers game, you can plan your turns out far in advance - and sometimes you really do need to. 

The complexity is definitely a barrier to entry, however. Many of the initial reviews mentioned that the game was unfair or unbalanced, but in my opinion it’s just really complex. There are a dozen things that you need to consider during a fight. How many turns will it take for your units to activate, are there any effects that the enemies have that will change this plan, will your attack from your unit get counter attacked? There’s more and more, but once you get the hang of it, it’s really a rewarding experience.

[h1]Experimentation breeds success[/h1]

This is kind of both a pro and a con. The pro part of it is that there are some cards that don’t look good on the surface that in practice are. Similarly, some options on the map might look lacklustre at first but end up being run changers.

The con part of it is that there are some interactions that aren’t outlined exactly. Some charms (permanent card buffs) don’t work with some cards, and some effects increase the numbers of some cards in unexpected ways. It takes a bit of getting used to and I think this is usually a healthy amount of experimentation that exists in most games, it just feels a little frustrating sometimes when it breaks a run that you’ve spent the time and effort into building. Once you get pass the first few runs, however, it’s pretty obvious how everything interacts with one another.

[h1]The verdict couldn’t be easier[/h1]

Get it! If you enjoy card games, if you enjoy strategic roguelikes, if you love a well-presented game with deep combat. It’s a wonderful game and I’m very excited to see what updates they have for it. 

Don’t get it if you don’t like thinking too much! And I don’t mean that in a condescending manner, it really will just end up being frustrating - it was for me initially until I could get over the hump. Sometimes for games all we want is to chill and not spend time agonisng over our decisions. That's all good.

The 3 different decks add some interesting variety and within those decks there are multiple synergies that you can pursue to get a different types of victory.

A few things I would like to say though.  

First:  Devs - Plz do not let the negative reviewers con you into turning this extremely well designed tactical combat/ deckbuilder card game into a lame reskin of Monster Train.  The ideas they want you to adopt from Monster Train do not need to be layered on top of this game.  Outcome previews in a tactical game where you can freely rearrange your units is a very poor idea and would remove a large puzzle element that makes this game very rewarding to master.  Also, being able to reroll the shop and being able to skip adding a card at the add a card event are a dumbing down of the balanced mechanics already implemented in the game.  The shop doesn't need a reroll for any reason other than to make the game easier, and if you really don't want to add another card make better pathing choices and learn to work within the given game structure.  PS you can freely remove companion cards from your deck.

Second: I have played the game more on the Switch than Steam so far and one thing I have noticed is that when I do miscalculate and die on the PC I have no way of learning what I did wrong because the turn plays out so quickly leading to the you are dead screen and there isn't a way to go back and examine exactly what happened so you can internalize your mistake.  On the Switch I can just hit the record button and watch the turn play out again.  Idk if there is a way to sidestep this on the PC version, but I can see it being a slight hindrance for players trying to learn the game.

The game is incredibly fun and very rewarding.  I highly recommend to anyone that enjoys tactical deckbuilders.  Thank you so much for this gem!","0","1682227939","true","272","413","0","1","0","0","0","0"

The difficulty is perfectly fine, but it does demand that the player be very familiar with similar roguelites. There's a strong focus on assembling clever combinations of effects that would be overpowered in most other games, but are required to progress here. If you aren't as experienced, or just get unlucky, then the enemies quickly scale out of control and fights become literally unwinnable.
That said, there is still some balancing to be done. Some enemies and mechanics are frustrating and unfair to all but the most game-breaking builds.

Combines some of the best traits of Monster Train, Slay the Spire, and Slice & Dice while putting its own unique spin on the mechanics. The way it handles its mana system and branching paths is familiar to roguelike deckbuilder veterans, but it definitely has its own flavor that is wholly its own.

The game definitely has its own metagame to learn and figure out. Certain mechanics and interactions may throw you off the first time you see them, and the difficulty curve is steep. It's of the sort that makes you want to start up a new run after losing, so I'm quite fond of the game's difficulty. I'm hoping we get a future DLC or expansion to push the design space even further. 9 hours in, I think there's a lot of potential for both ally and enemy design within the space.

High recommend to anyone big into roguelike deckbuilders.

This is the first time in my entire life when i bought a game because i got mad at player scores. 
In 1.5 hours i have beat the floor 2 final boss (floor 3 if you count the first fight, which ends in a minor boss fight) on my third run.
I am not saying this as some mad gamer flex, nor do i wish to insult the people making negative reviews. I am saying this because if you have ever beaten a couple of bosses in slay the spire or one some matches in hearthsones arena ( actual matches, not the get 'max wins for epic key' thing) then you absolutely have the brain power to play this game. And any complaints about 'out of balance difficulty' is simply a need to start thinking about the game differently then other card games.
For example Slay the spire, Hearthstone, Magic all have the mana mechanic which limits how many cards you can play during your turn. In this game all combatants have a countdown timer before they get to attack or trigger their powers. And this counter globally goes down by 1 every time you play a card.  Which means the 'mana' becomes a measurement of time on the battlefield. Moving your cards around the battlefield is a free action, removing them from the field is also a free action but your monsters do get thrown in the discard pile for doing this, so you will need to re draw and play your companions later. But recalling them also heals them so removing your monsters can not only help with attrition it could also help avoid AoE attacks that could cover half the screen. 
Usually games force your monsters to sit in one place after you play them, or removing  from the field demands a card effect that does just that. And this is where i believe the heart of 'game 2 hawd D: ' criticism comes from.  If you do not manipulate the field liberally during a fight( free action, costs no time mana) you will lose because this game does ramp up fast with enemy power so you must be on your toes.
To counter balance this enemy scaling the game does offer you some crazy flexibility in card upgrades. There are charms that you could get that can give you powerful effects like 'increase effect by 6 and the card becomes 1 use per battle'. Do you know what you can do with this? Increase a cards freezing effect by  an extra 6 time ticks locking the enemy you hit with it out of the fight for a very long time, give a crazy damage boost to your poison ablility. I used it on a buff card that gives me plus 1 attack damage. It then becomes a plus 7 attack, so i converted the 'gib +natty effect potency' into a mad damage boost. Floor 2 final boss had 30 hp by the way. Not only can i buff a multiattack monster with this i can also USE THIS NEW CARD ON THE CARDS IN MY HAND!. That's right, you can also apply card effects unto cards in your hand thus also changing their versatility during a fight.
I understand that the human card art can get a little bit too 'call arts' style in the face department, but i urge you to overlook this if you find 'call arts' or  generally 'cute' styles off putting. Because this game offers a strong challenge with fast ramping enemies while providing you with borderline card creation in versatility of responses and synergies you can concoct. Also shops offer you 'crowns' to buy for like 80 gold. Take some. It not only forces the crowned cards into your hand at the start of the duel but it also uses no time ticks  to play them, giving you mad starting tempo.

This is my first deck builder game, and I am absolutely in love with it. I've played rouge-likes, and have a lot of exposure to slay the spire content from twitch. If either is your cup of tea, then I whole heartily recommend this game. Honestly all I really want is more content, because everything about this game bleeds amazing character and heart. Its aesthetics are a personal soft spot for me, audio is great, and interactions feel amazing (breaking the ice on companion stops; truly top notch). Nothing I've touched, albeit from a limited exposure for the time being, feels completely worthless or broken. Synergies support each other well, but rabbit holing can leave you unprepared for certain mechanics/match ups. Figuring out how to make a well rounded and functional deck is a blast, but it did take me about ~13 hrs for my first win. If you are gonna pick this game up expect an adjustment period, that will be well rewarded if you enjoy the game play and take your time.

frame of reference: Huge Slay the spire fan,loved Inscryption.did not particularly enjoy Monster train..and i am NOT good at them

I didn't know about Wildfrost,therefore i missed the demo,i was immediately caught by the art style and was on a high after completing Inscryption,i was itching to scratch that itch but i was held back off of the mixed reception on launch(reviews)....Opened a stream and left it on the background and was intrigued by the amount of mechanics so i decided to try it for myself

Oh boy i got mad hooked...the game is hard yes *but* in the way any game like this is,until you learn how it works and hone your skills from repetition and failure and it does this well by introducing mechanics that will demolish you at first [spoiler] (i am looking at you wild boars) [/spoiler] .
The element of RNG is there in a lot of ways,but can be overcome,although since the runs are pretty lengthy(bit less of an hour for me) which can be a little daring for most people.

Cute artstyle, lots of deckbuilding combos to pull off, and getting combos that destroy groups of enemies is super satisfying. As of writing this, I have almost 100%'d the game. The only thing I have left to do is to beat a daily run. The game is hard, yes, but it's not impossible. In fact, I won my first ever run, but I did get very lucky. Expect to lose a lot of runs to mechanics you've never seen before, but that's part of being a roguelike. A few criticisms of the game however:

1: In most Slay the Spire (STS) esq rougelikes, you have a persistent HP pool. In STS, if you make a mistake or have a bad draw, you'll lose health, but you won't lose the run unless you were in a tight spot already. In Wildfrost, you lose as soon as your leader is KO'd once, and your leader doesn't have much HP. A lot of later enemies will one shot your leader if you make a mistake or don't get the right draw. Because of this, every run is always on a knife's edge, which is both a positive and negative. There is also one fight against enemies that hit hard, but pick targets randomly. This often means you have to roll the dice, hoping they don't hit and one shot your leader. It's never fun to lose a run to a 1 in 3 dice roll.
2: There are certain mechanics the game doesn't explain super well. The most important of which is moving your units around. You can move your units around as much as you want during your turn, even though the game somewhat implies you can only do it once per turn. This is crucial, and if you don't get that, you're likely to think the game is unfair. Another thing is companions' health. The game describes KO-ing an enemy as 'killing' them, so you think that if your companions get KO'd, they're gone for good. That's not the case. Instead, they get 'injured' and the game says 'if they survive the next battle, they'll recover'. This led me to believe, 'okay, if they get KO'd while injured, then they're gone for good', but again, no. If they're KO'd while injured, they just stay injured. The game could certainly explain better what risks you can and can't take.","0","1682203550","true","1427","4055","0","8","0","0","0","0"

However, this is one of the least fun rogue deckbuilders I've played (coming from a big fan of the genre). I see a lot of complaints on difficulty curve - but in my humble opinion, it is not the absolute difficulty but the man-made difficulty in how poorly the mechanics interact with each other and the loss of control/mastery the player can feel. Three things really ruined it for me:

1. The complete lack of enemies preview, aftermath for specific skills, and hitbox. There's absolutely no knowing what/how many enemies are in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th wave of combat, to plan ahead and save certain spells accordingly. This is made a lot worse by the fact that certain enemies would reborn and turn into something else even after being defeated for the first time - usually in a much stronger version, but which the game gives absolutely no heads-up for. Not having a preview for what can happen upon using a specific spell is very frustrating given how many of the spells in game are double-edged swords (reduce HP by 3 and give 5 shields for example) 

2. How the draw system inherently punishes players for clearing a wave of enemies in the most efficient manner. In short, the monsters in this game come by waves, with a set interval that usually lasts 3-4 turn. However, if you were able to clear out the enemies on turn 1, instead of rewarding the players in some way, the game actually accelerates the next wave of monsters to arrive immediately. This effectively take away 2-3 opportunities to play a card from the player and can be a severe punishment under the current system. Towards later playthroughs, I've had to painstakingly slow down my skills/companions, just so that I keep 1-2 enemy weaklings alive and be able to play the cards I want to play without being rushed by the game. This severely harms the game's pacing, making you feel like in a dumb tango dance.

3. My favorite deckbuilders all have wonderful elements of randomness built in (e.g., Monster Train, STS) However, that is NOT the randomly generated hero you get upon start of each run here. Each run might have heroes with completely different base attack/effect/interaction potential. This really hampers the player's ability to learn any particular system well and thus be able to enjoy the 'rogue-like' elements of the game. Each run really feels like a luck of the draw. 

I hope to be able to return to this a few months later and see a game that has gameplay on par with its amazing art, lore, and music. Until then, I might have to waste my time somewhere else.","0.574137449264526367","1682199138","false","187","1381","0","2","0","61","1","0"

First, the good. The game has an absolutely fun core. The art is incredible, the little details are very cool, and the music rules. Getting a great synergy or combating a play when you feel like everything is useless and coming out ontop rules. One of my favorite runs was when I got a hero that I thought I'd just throw in the trash and start over on. I stuck it through. They wound up breezing through the final boss, even with medallions turned on. That felt great. The good cards feel wonderful to play and put down, and again, I cannot stress this enough -- turning a losing battle into a winning one feels super great.

That said, the game absolutely has balancing issues. Certain builds are nigh useless -- and you may be stuck with them, because the only completely non-random chance you have in the game is which clan you pick and what pet you bring with you. Even your hero is randomized, meaning you will sometimes get a hero with the exact same ability yet with lower stats. The unlocks have almost no middle ground in terms of difficulty getting them -- they are all either extremely easy or extremely difficult, so there is not a sense of power scaling and after a certain point there's zero reason you should keep going with an awful build. Some cards are great and synergize well with almost anything and some cards require a full commitment for very little payoff. A sacrifice build requires an extremely specific setup -- action economy is king, so wasting a turn on killing your allies when you could be doing anything to the enemies sucks ass. Meanwhile, cards like Big Berry and Frostcake are almost always useful.

And at least what I've found with the game while playing through it, that's kind of what determines a win: either having a deck made of these generically good cards or getting really lucky with synergy. I once waltzed into the final battle with only two allies and a medallion active and crushed it, all based around getting extremely lucky with a good synergy. Sure, there was skill in doing it. But I really was just lucky.

That said, in spite of me writing a book complaining about this game I still cannot stop playing it. If you enjoy games like Darkest Dungeons and FTL, even if you lose all the time, you'll probably have fun. If you're very very good at cards games, you'll also probably have fun. If you like to have bragging rights over beating a challenging game, you'll probably also enjoy gloating. But you will have a miserable time if you do not fall into any of these camps.

So my answer is: it depends. Pick it up and try it, and refund it in the two hours if it makes you angry.

Now that you've read through this, here's some tips that I've picked up as a baby shitty casual player that might help other baby casual players that want to give this a shot:

- Learn to shift allies around the rows and columns. Learn to shift them based on the enemy turns, learn to shift them based on their attacks, and learn to shift them based on HP. Don't have your hero tank a hit for 3 damage when you could do it with an ally that has 4 hp and just attacked. If an enemy is using barrage, it's better for them to hit the one ally you've put into their row than the three allies beneath it.
- Planning out your turns compared to the enemies is crucial. Does your ally have 1 HP and 1 turn to attack? Don't withdraw them unless an enemy will hit them or they'll be hit with spikes. Let them get their attack them withdraw them. Don't use attack buffing items on an ally that has 5 turns to attack when you could play a frost stick that delays an enemy.
- The game revolves around action economy, so anything that increases yours and reduces the enemy's is king. Crowns, noomins and anything that freezes are great. Even hitting bosses with a freeze stick might delay them just enough to get a kill.
- Don't sleep on status effects, almost all of them are useful. Overburn effectively reduces enemy HP, AND they explode at the end. Freeze delays an enemy's turn. Poison is... well, I mean, it's a DoT, that's almost always useful. Bom never goes away and increases damage done to a target, even with items. This makes any charms that apply status effects extremely useful with an ally that multiattacks, like Foxee.
- Keep your deck small. Having a bigger deck means you will have less of a chance getting the cards you want. Don't be afraid to feed stuff to Munch. Remember that allies can be removed from decks, so if your deck is solid and don't want to risk fucking it up prioritize any frozen traveler paths over the chests.
- Also don't be afraid of hitting the bell and drawing your cards early. If your hand has two scrappy swords it's probably better to just redraw and see if you can't get something more useful. 
- Play allies early and often. They have to count their turns down, so putting them out as early as possible to get them rolling is critical, and should always be a priority unless there's another extremely good play to make.
- You can just restart if you're not feeling your deck. Exit the game to main menu, click on the gate, and then give up the run. No reason to sit in a build you know will fail. Really wish they had a restart button, but alas.
- Anything that relies on random chance is almost always worse than anything guaranteed.
- If something is aimless, assume it will kill whatever does not have enough HP to tank it. Don't rely on luck unless you're forced to. Withdraw and plan accordingly.
- You can unequip crowns from allies.

Don't let those cute pictures fool you, it's a hard game and you will need to think your steps carefully if you want to success!!!

Since there are toons of reviews with the same comments, let's just say, buy the game if you like a true Roguelike (you will die many many many times, until you start to get used to it).

If you want a game to relax and have fun maybe this is not the game, because it can make you frustrate and make your brain work a lot!!!

The negative reviews are about players who maybe didn't had many experience in this kind of games or thought it was just placing your cards and that's all, but it's more like playing Chess, every moment counts, a wrong move will make you lose.

Buy the game if you are used to challenge games, don't buy the game if you think it's too much hard for you.

It's been a long time since I didn't enjoyed a game so much since Slay the Spire!!! The rest of the Deck Builders were ok, but not adictive as Wildfrost and Slay the Spire X)","0","1681908411","true","1303","10596","0","42","0","1","0","0"

A lot of the positive reviews are just those scraping barely 20 hours at most into the game. The more you play you will realize there's a lot of small things which are very frustrating like the bad charms given almost at every part, skipping characters depending on what path you choose. And speaking of GUI, it's very chaotic with up to 12 characters on the board and having to control everyone. While it's great in concept and art style I think they need more GUI improvements to the game. Slay the Spire is still top tier in terms of gameplay. There's a REASON why it gets so many negative reviews, and the people who came here hearing it's hard and are like 'well I beat it so it's not hard' are not looking at the fundamentals of why it's hard. It's ANNOYING having to keep track of everyone on the board and sometimes having bad RNG on bosses with the bells like the charms giving smackback to a boss that hits 7x will make you understand why it's unbalanced.","0.509444355964660645","1682181074","false","3237","5552","0","43","0","5","0","0"

Pretty addictive loop - short games means that restarts are more compelling, less 'wasted' time, nice meta-progression.

Definitely up there with Slay the Spire as far as deckbuilding roguelikes go - front of the pack in its category.

Only major balancing issue I've continuously noticed is that the devs think that 'Aimless' (attacks a random target) is a balancing factor for enemies, when it actually makes them infinitely more dangerous. An aimless enemy can snipe your leader from behind solid cover, and because their Aimlessness is supposed to be a mitigating factor, unless your leader is a tank thay will almost always kill the leader outright due to their inflated damage. Their inflated health will, likewise, make it very hard to stop this from happening.

I've lost most of my runs where I ragequit after to the specific combat where this is a problem, in the snowy caves.","0","1682179061","true","1414","2741","0","10","0","0","0","1"

There's just enough here to make it different from the other big boy deckbulders, and it never feels spammy like some of them can be (as fun as that can be). 

My only criticism at the moment is a I wish theyd give us a little bit *MORE*, that the game was a tad bit kinder a tad bit more generous.

There are several different types of cards, which can all be upgraded through various 'charms', which can give that card a wide range of extra abilities and adds extra uniqueness to each run. Your starting card is considered your 'leader'. It will always be out, and if it's killed you lose the run. It's a neat mechanic.

The game features three factions with each a different playstyle:
1. Snowdwellers: A focus on status effects to gain an advantage: shields, (temporary) attack boosts, poison. freezes, etc.
2. Shademancers: Have the ability to summon units, which can be sacked to take heavy hits or killed by yourself to gain other big bonuses.
3. Clunkmasters: A playstyle revolving around generating and destroying (recycling) (useless) junk cards in combination with clunker-cards that can take hits for you.

Now, this IS a hard game, and it can be very unforgiving if you make a single mistake. Missed that an enemy has teeth (deal damage when hit) or smackback (attacks back on a hit)? Overlooked an enemy's frenzy (attack multiple times) or aimless (hit any target in the row)? Well, that can end a run, especially with the game's 'leader' mechanic.

Don't expect to win every single run. However, do expect a lot of fun when you start finding card-interactions that form ridiculous combos.","0","1682169071","true","1360","5619","0","7","0","1","0","1"

Difficulty has been heavily debated in other reviews, and my opinion is simply that the easiest difficult of Wildfrost is comparably higher than the easiest difficult of StS for example (Ascension 0 or 1), while the hardest difficulty of Wildfrost does not make the game much harder IMO, compared to how Ascension 20 in StS makes the game exponentially harder.

Also, due to the combat systems of Wildfrost, a single mistake can cost your run, so it requires players to stay focused almost constantly, especially when not yet used to the system. It requires thinking ahead, but once you are used to it, it is possible to win consistently (my max wins in a row is 6 at the moment of writing).

The soundtrack and sound design are also excellent, and I think this game could become really amazing if modding adds more content, or extensions come up in the future, with alternate mechanics, monsters, bosses, tribes, and maybe a bit more meta progression in the town as well.

I think it's worth it's price tag, and it's a refreshing take on the genre. Also the achievement hunting part is pretty fun (besides the achievement to kill the final boss with a scrappy sword which was a pain to get)","0.502617835998535156","1682159894","true","1493","1502","0","34","0","1","0","0"

My first 5 runs were rough; I don't think I even made it to the boss fight in those first games. But I learned pretty quickly what cards were out there and how they synergize. And each game I got further and further. After those first 5 defeats came my first 'Victory?'. It was SO gratifying that I had to go for another one right away. On the run right after my first win? Another victory which was one turn away from a defeat. And after that second win? Another victory. 

I am now 8 runs through: 5 Straight losses. 3 straight wins. 

I feel that while this game is difficult, you can learn to beat it. And this is coming from someone who reaallllyyyy sucks at Slay the Spire. 

If you love roguelite deckbuilders, this is a must have. Solid mechanics, rewarding learning curve, and beautiful artwork make this game at least a 9/10 in its category.","0","1682142316","true","374","403","0","12","0","0","0","1"

This game is a great mix of tactics, deckbuilder, and roguelike.  Think Monster Train and slay the spire had a child.

I see the negative reviews calling the game 'unbalanced and too hard'.  Honestly that's garbage.  I have 30 hours and beat all the bosses.  It takes time and practice to understand what cards and abilities work well together and don't work well against certain bosses.  I love the mechanic of facing my old parties, it keeps the game fresh.

Pros:
More interactive than monster train as you can move units around
Very quick games, a full run can be under an hour
Simple mechanics make it easy to learn while still having complex interactions
So.  Many.  Deck types
Animation and art excellent
Fresh boss fights (so long as you're winning)

Cons:
Steep learning curve (makes wins so satisfying though)



TL;DR:
Quit negative review bombing and git gud scrubs

Every run starts with picking a leader from 1 of 3 tribes each with semi randomised stats and abilities, while this is not inherently a bad mechanic it dose present some problems, for example if you are interested in using 1 tribe because you want to play around one of that tribe specific abilities but the leader for that tribe is just randomised poorly (low attack, long turn count, bad ability) the only way to get a new set of leaders is to chose a leader, then a companion, start a run, then quit to the main menu, then return to the hub, chose to end the current run then finally look at the next 3 random leaders to chose from. 

i get that randomness is a big theme in the game but the leader is your central point if they die its instant game over which is just frustrating when you leader can start with 6 health and a lot of enemy's can deal more than 6 damage in a single hit. 

There are a couple of ways i can see to make this better having a reroll option on the leader selection even if you have to beat the game a couple of times first before its unlocked, or better yet a way to build a custom leader so if you want to play with a specific ability you can easy do so without the need to of waiting to find the randomised leader to do so. 

I want to like this game and i did have fun on many of my runs but in between those fun runs were hours of quitting and starting again so i could play a leader that fit the abilities i wanted to play at the time.

I'm seeing some reviews straight up say that they *like* the game and/or will continue to play it, but due to XYZ reason still give it a thumbs down, which is absurd.

I don't really care if it's the best rogue-like deckbuilder ever made or how long it takes to clear, I'm having fun.

EDIT: Woo I cleared it on my third run!  I will say, it's different from other games of its kind and the onboarding/tutorial is quite bare, which probably is part of why a lot of people are struggling with it.  But I don't agree with the complaints of balancing or RNG at all.  Some decks you build aren't going to cut the mustard, but that's how it goes - learn from that and have fun building better decks in the future.

And *take your time* with the turns - each turn is like a puzzle, and there are a lot of moving pieces in the later fights.  If you just slam cards down and do the first thing that comes to mind, you will miss things, and the enemies will slap you around.

This system gives the game a chess-like feel, where gaining tempo is key to success. You must plan several moves ahead, keeping track of everyone's counter and positions. It's a lot to take in, but successfully putting it together makes the victory all the sweeter.

Is the game hard? Yes. Absolutely. It's not any worse than Slay the Spire or Monster Train, but whereas those games start off easy and unlock new difficulties as you progress, here the game starts off hard. You will lose a lot of runs while learning all the mechanics.

Is the game unbalanced? Hard to say just yet. Some builds feel harder to pull off than others, but that might just be due to my inexperience rather than a balancing issue. What I can say is that every run has been fun to play.

Edit: After playing for 21 hours, I can safely say that this game is fairly balanced. I've won 4 of the 5 past runs and the loss was due to an error on my part that was easily avoidable.","0","1681651396","true","796","3868","0","9","0","0","0","0"

I'm not sure I agree exactly, but I know where they are coming from. The game feels really brutal and often unfair. All the cards feel too weak, all the enemies feel too strong. Progression doesn't get you much, just new possible cards and upgrades to find. The core gameplay is great, but it just feels rough to play.
That being said, I'll probably put a few more hours into it, to try to figure it out. I don't hate it, but only get this if you know what you are getting into.
Also, the presentation is really charming, which helps take the edge of the experience a tiny bit.

Edit: So I've played 8 more hours, really gave it the old college try, and it's still too brutal.
I've beaten it twice and it felt like a fluke both times. You really need to play perfectly. A single mistake ends your run, which is very frustrating.
I think it would be possible to make a game this hard without wasting quite so much of my time. Would recommend only for those who like banging their head against the wall.","0.53947371244430542","1681382659","false","334","864","0","34","596","4","0","0"

While it certainly takes a lot from popular deckbuilders, like Slay the Spire as most have already mentioned, it has its own unique systems. One way of describing it could be that it feels like a grid-based turn-based rpg where your units attack and activate their abilites at specfic times and your job is to position them and use items to help them win the battle. If you're reading this, you've probably been reading other reviews as well so I'll just cut to the more controversial elements of the game.

While I do think the UI is very well-done considering how much information there is on the screen at any time, all of that information can get a bit overwhelming sometimes and players might just miss a something vital. I certainly have accidently made a play only to immediately die right after because I had missed some ability. I have seen streamers do the same and have read reviews that complain about it as well. What might help is to have some warning over the leader character if they're going to get killed if nothing is done (and a possible death symbol in the case of aimless enemies). Something that could grab the player's attention and make them look for what they might be missing. An undo option would be fantastic as well, maybe you can only use it once per battle so that everything still retains the heavy consequences or in a separate mode altogether. Right now, at least for me, most battles require full concentration to make sure everything is taken into account. I actually quite like that, but some options to take the load off for a bit would definitely be welcomed.

Some have complained that the game punishes you too hard for finally winning with a good team by then making you fight against that very team in the next run. I see it as a great way for the game to invite the players to try other playstyles. Great job you won, now create a team and a deck that can beat the team you just won with. The game gives you the chance to prepare for that final encounter by allowing you to see exactly what enemies you will be facing in it (before the run and during it as well). Sure you might not get the cards you were hoping for in the run right after but you might still win if you try. I definitely wasn't expecting to win my last run and was on the verge of losing pretty much every turn since the start, but I somehow managed to squeeze in a win and it felt great! Most battles in general feel impossible, especially when the boss/miniboss shows up, but the game more often than not gives you the tools to find a way to win and because of that every victory feels like a big accomplishment. Of course, luck plays a role, but from what I've seen I think it is possible to get good enough to win most runs.

If it looks like something you will like, you probably will. Just don't come in with expectations of what it's supposed to be like based on other deckbuilders. I rarely write reviews but I felt like I had to this time since I think the game deserves much more praise than it is being given.

Is it hard? Yes. 
Is it too hard? Most likely. 
Is it unfair? Probably

But even with those caveats it's still very entertaining and worth a look. Very much recommend, and if it gets balanced a smidge it'll only get better.

Edit: Now that I've played it more, the game is honestly not even that difficult compared to other of its contemporaries (StS, Across the Obelisk, Monster Train, etc.) It does have a learning curve and some runs are just kinda doomed, but that comes with the territory of these types of games.

Wildfrost is hard. It gives the enemies so many initial advantages. But over the course of the games you realise that using careful planning and by manipulating your rng just enough, you can make the enemies play by your rules instead (unless you meet a Drek). It's this part that I feel most people are missing, that the game gives you so many ressources to customise your run that you can do ANYTHING.

From buffing card directly in your hand to using enemy interactions to create devastating combos, and with an incredible score, I feel like this game deserves a second chance in the face of the initial Mixed reviews (which, as I've seen, have been thankfully steadily increasing).

You will have to persevere, but once you start 'getting it' you will find yourself winning more.

This is a gorgeous game, clearly made with love, but the way it currently works means that some runs are basically impossible due to RNG.
For reference, I've finished Slay the Spire, Roguebook, and the likes. After 10 hours, I haven't been able to finish Wildfrost even ONCE.
Good RNG is the one that, despite the randomness, you can still puzzle out a survival strategy.
In Wildfrost, however, sometimes you're just shoved into an unwinnable situation.

For instance, one of the possible stages has enemies with spikes and enemies that makes you aimless - its over if you don't have attack cards (not units). It's over specially fast if one of your units attacks multiple times.

Not to mention that I cannot re-roll the few starting heroes. Come on now. Clearly some of them are much better, and sometimes the 3 ones available are awful.

Here's hoping they can sort it out.","0.493904769420623779","1681832619","false","703","1462","0","8","0","3","1","0"

At the time of this review I have done 11 runs, so around 1 an hour, and i won 7 of those including my first two attempts at playing the game.

Rewards strategy and planning. It has much less rng then other games like it. You have complete information about what your opponents do and when they do it. I like the way they change up the final boss fight.

There are lots of different viable builds.  The meta progression are all mostly side grades. It doesn't feel like i am getting stronger or that the games is getting easier as i play, just more choices.

It is not as easy to completely break as most other rogue-likes i have played which honestly makes it a little less fun for me. Can feel a little slow at times.","0","1682115753","true","690","1243","0","19","0","0","0","0"

It isn't that the game is hard, it is that the game severely punishes careless errors.  There is no undo button and no way to preview a battle.  No warning about making a play that will end the run.  It saves with every card played, so you can't get around it quit reload or alt-f4.  

That said, it's good.  There is a lot of content and I expect more to come later.  The runs are about 30-50 minutes, a really good length, especially since accidental losses happen, at least you're not losing a 2-hour run because you missed a keyword or cards interacted in unexpected ways.

The main gimmick of the game is that you can re-arrange your army between rounds as a free action.  

Be aware you can cast spells on cards in hand.  

Tutorial is lacking and the game does next to no hand holding.

I find it absurdly rough for little reason. In my opinion, the game definitely needs some reexamination and readjustment. In short, I think this game has issues with the difficulty curve increasing way faster than your power does and being able to form a build that works (which may stem from the issue on difficulty).

Played for around 8 hours and in 22 runs, I got close to completing a run once on one of my earlier attempts. I got to the final boss, but because of the boss fight prior, all my units were injured from keeping my leader alive and stuck at half health and attack. I never even got passed the second zone again.

I find that enemies' damage and lethality ramp up tremendously faster than yours. In the second area, I end up getting overwhelmed by the enemies because by the time I'm close to finishing one of three enemies off, 3 more enemies enter the fight. And those 3 enemies get to ramp up. And then the boss unit spawns while you're trying to tread water. And then some more enemies spawn for good measure.
It can even be suspicious in the first zone's boss fight. The fight starts and enemies can already start ramping up their damage, while you still need to get out on the field and set up. By the time you're able to heavy damage to the boss, you've probably taken a decent number of hits and the wave is stacking behind the boss. It's doable, but still suspicious.

I think building a team that can deal with all the challenges is extremely difficult. I also think getting some sort of build becomes progressively harder as you unlock more things in the game. IIRC, the closest run I had was before I unlocked a majority of the other build types. I was using a build that tried to inflict double-damage debuffs and capitalize on it because the leader could inflict the debuff. Once I unlocked the other types of leaders, I don't think I saw that type of leader again. I tried forming other teams focused around  inflicting poison, defensively inflicting poison, healing, using the gnomes and their trash/recycle mechanic, sacrificing, using overburn, and a few other mechanics. The builds were probably not great, but I felt I wasn't given the chance to get them off the ground fast enough due to how fast the difficulty spikes.

When I tried the overburn build, only a handful of cards and units inflict the debuff. If you don't get them, you don't really inflict the debuff quick enough (honestly, even with the correct cards, it seems like it will take a bit of time to setup and inflict overburn). And then you still need to damage the enemies for the overburn to explode, so you need regular units and attacks. You'll still probably need to heal and stop enemies, etc etc. As you unlock more cards and other types, a bunch of them go into the same pool. I felt I wasn't given enough power. On a 7 turn cooldown, my leader would inflict 3 instances of the debuff only. That's cool and all, but the enemy that killed me is on a 4 turn cooldown, does 7 damage, and can randomly hit any target at any position. My leader has 6 max hp.

Otherwise, the artstyle and aesthetic of the game is great. It's cute, vibrant, and punchy. The strategy aspect of the game is really cool and was what drew me into the game in the first place. Most of the mechanics are interesting enough to play around with.

I'm no stranger to a difficult game, but eh, the difficulty in this game doesn't feel quite right. For the average person, I can't really recommend this game in the current state.","0","1682073461","false","474","750","0","1","0","1","0","0"

While this game is certainly not flawless, it is up there in terms of greatness with Slay the Spire and Monster Train. Just as a preface, this is coming from someone who has done Ascension 20 on all but the ironclad in Slay the Spire and Covenant 25 with all clan permutations in Monster Train, so I definitely have experience in the genre. People who complain about the difficulty in this game have 2 general reasons why they experience it: either they have not fully interfaced with all the components of the game (recalling your units, trying to focus combos for extra money, etc.) or they are simply not good at strategy deck builders. Don't get me wrong, this game is difficult (especially if you make careless decisions) but not overly difficult.  

All this being said, this game still has flaws: I really think you should be able to pick your desired clan and then pick your leader from 3 of that clan. This would make it so I don't have to keep playing snow or shroom builds because those leaders tend to just be stronger than the randomized ones for the other clans. Some ordering is not fully explained: will snow stop this enemy from using smackback if my initial smack is the one that snows? Lastly, you should be able to refuse your card options in the treasure chest map event for some bling: sometimes I am fishing for a certain card but going to these events will often just bloat my deck. 

All in all, this is one of the few games I, as a broke college kid, would ever pay full price for. It is good, but certainly, not a walk in the park as its graphics style would lead you to believe.","0.523809552192687988","1682114974","true","576","1875","0","13","228","1","0","1"

This is a Roguelite game which means you will lose a lot, you have to approach this kinds of games with this mentality. It's hard but that's like saying you don't enjoy a FPS because you have to aim, that's the nature of FPS games and as a Roguelite/Roguelike is similar to Enter the Gungeon, Pixel Dungeon, etc. where you don't expect to beat it at the first run, it actually would be no fun. A good Roguelike is super replayable and this game is not exception.

The deck building in this game is super super enjoyable, there are a lot of different options and you can beat the game in your first run, the only problem is that a lot of unexpected things will happen so it's hard but that's the nature of the roguelike genre, you learn by playing and understanding deeper the game so the next run you get farther away.

The game is very positional and I love that it reminds me of another game called Scrolls (which was a card game from Mojang), if you have ever played that the feeling is quite similar.","0","1682110419","true","534","2261","0","2","0","0","0","0"

But after a few runs I'm going to say that the game is just awesome and it greatly exceeded everything I expected from it.
Yes sometimes there are RNG moments, but that's inherently something that's to be expected from a card game. Although there is one really questionable mechanic ([spoiler]aimless[/spoiler]), which really doesn't feel fun in my opinion, almost everything else is either deterministic (during the fight) or can be mitigated enough (building your deck such as you can defeat any kind of enemies, which you somewhat fast learn). So no, the game doesn't feel more RNG than eg Slay the Spire to me.
Other complaints say that the game is hard and unforgiving. I somewhat agree with these sentiments, but maybe that also adds to the experience. And I don't think it's 'too much', you just have to listen when the game tries to teach you the mechanics (and remember them :D). Not that there are some crazy unintuitive mechanics, but you can easily forget that you can actually recall your companions etc. Also there isn't any undo button, so sometimes you might actually screw something up by not having the correct unit placements when playing the card (which triggers the 'turn' of attacks) and that can be VERY unforgiving and frustrating, but yeah, overall I feel like the balance is OK.

So overall, I really recommend this little gem of a greatly polished game","0.52173912525177002","1682107513","true","379","2438","0","4","0","1","0","0"

I like that the town building aspect gives you specific things to do to unlock new characters, cards, etc, because in games like this I often find myself falling into my same routine builds and playstyles. The way the unlock progression works encourages you to try different things and tells you specifically what you need to do to get the next unlock.

No hate to Will please.[/b]

This was initially a very detailed negative review. However, I don't think i can truly not recommend this game when I played it for 45 hours in the last week, eagerly kept coming back for more, and 100%'d it. Hell, I even actively said to a friend yesterday 'You would probably like Wildfrost.'

It's true, this game [b]is[/b] unbalanced in certain ways. Random charms on enemies can single-handedly lose you a run. 15/7 4 countdown Aimless is absurd stats for cost when Aimless is a bane for the player but a boon for enemies. There are many elements to the game where it feels as if player agency has been stripped away, and the RNG leader selection can lead to some awful situations, especially if you're forced to run a specific tribe due to the 'final' boss.

And yet, god, what a glorious game. Two dudes, five feet apart in the dev room, making a game with so much visual clarity in polish that you'd be forgiven for thinking this was a big studio release. The gameplay is challenging, the mechanics are clean, and the art is second to none.

It really is charming and addictive. And every time that I've died, be it my own misplay or unavoidable BS, regardless, I've usually hopped back in 5 minutes later. Certain interactions give so much joy and the switch from 'how do i beat this fight' to 'how do I counter the final boss' to 'how do I max combos for gold' to 'how do I get Woolly Drek to eat the Gobling and beat him like a pinata for infinite gold' to 'wtf is this vase'. 

It's a game with a nice variety of depth despite it's flaws. I've listed a few below, but with the 14/04 Dev Blog I'm hoping a few of these will be touched on:
[list]
[*] Unlock management; having to fully unlock one thing before even beginning progress on the next feels a little obnoxious.
[*] Leader RNG; sometimes, man, they truly just do suck and your choices get hamstrung. A reroll button that refreshes on death/Victory would be nice.
[*] Modifier Bells; Bell 1 can created some of the most brutally punishing or unfair scenarios imaginable; particularly in relation to teeth, which can't be frozen, inked, or affected in any way other than killing the unit themselves, very problematic on certain enemies. Conversely, Bell 2 is actually Easy Mode, but more on that in a moment. Bell 3 is a fun variant but christ that True Final Boss is a lunatic, haven't been able to cook up an answer yet.\|
[*] Wave Management; if you take too long, more enemies. If you kill everything early, more enemies. The wave counter feels so limp that Bell 2 is essentially 'start your run with a free crown, and get combos more easily'. It would have been nice to gain +1 gold or +1 HP for each round left if you completed it early.
[*] A handful of enemies are a little too potent. Bigfoot is the infamous one that everyone loves to hate.
[*] Lastly, Dailies; they're great on their own, but as you've probably already noticed, they're flooded with cheaters pushing impossible scores - I might play one or two when the decks look fun, but the competitive edge to measure up isn't there at present.

[/list]

If you like other Rougelite Deckbuilders like Slay the Spire you will probably enjoy this game. 

It is not a “story mode” game.

If you buy this game and lose repeatedly on the first encounter maybe this genre of game just isn’t for you… and that is okay. For people looking for a true to form Rougelite Deckbuilder, I do not believe that the balance is off at all. I am not a deckbuilding master and I won on my second try.

The fact that this game sits at 'Mostly Positive' with so many negative reviews is a crime, and compels me to write a review.

This is perhaps the only card game that truly encapsulates the feel and experience of Rogue and the dungeon crawlers that gave the genre its name. Pretty much all the other games (like StS), focus heavily on the 'meta-progression' in order to win, in order to become powerful. Unlock this card, unlock this relic, unlock this trait, play and lose enough times, THEN you get to be strong enough to win, and even then you need RNG to help along the way. They mimic Rogue, but that wasn't what Rogue was about. Those old dungeon crawlers were games you were strong enough to win from the get-go - the roadblock was possessing the correct knowledge, patience, and game savvy to overcome the obstacles in the way. 

In every game trying to be the next StS, they lost touch with what StS was itself inspired by. Now, all these games just throw MORE stuff to unlock, MORE requirements to die before becoming strong. Some people like that - I find them just more grindy and boring. Wildfrost takes all that and smashes it with a hammer. Right from the first run, you have all kinds of tools to make insanely strong cards, but you don't yet know how to implement them to make that happen. And even if you do, you must carefully plan each turn due to the game's ingenious turn-based style countdowns, rather than the energy/mana system that literally EVERY other game uses. Even at your strongest, each card must be played carefully every turn, each future turn considered, each mechanic read, each card positioned in the optimal lane (another ingenious mechanic).

The game also cleverly gets around the short-comings that all others like it suffer from (yes, even StS). In StS, sometimes your runs are ruined on one turn because you draw badly. Sometimes your runs are ruined because you just never got the cards and relics you needed. Sometimes your runs were ruined because you randomed the ONE boss that counters your build. Not so in Wildfrost. Decks are extremely small, and it's incredibly easy to trim down to where you draw nearly your entire deck every turn, rewarding good player deck-building. There are also no 'bad cards' - every card has near infinite ways to tweak it in insanely powerful ways thanks to the charm system, which also gives you near infinite ways to break the game and win. Have a card that your entire run revolves around? Buy it a crown, so now it is GUARANTEED to be in your starting hand, and free to play! And best of all, every run you win, the end boss is replaced by a buffed version of YOUR party that beat it. You always know exactly what you are facing, and thus can build decks to counter that, while also giving unbelievable replayability. 

Added onto all of the incredible mechanics in the game, is the amazing art, music, and style. This is a truly uniquely special game. Is the game unforgiving? Yes. But so was Rogue, the game that created the genre. It's supposed to be, it's meant to be played slowly with thought, and I hope the devs don't change a damn thing. It's unfortunate to see that so many gamers don't understand what the genre is, and review bombing one of the best, most innovative games I've played because of it.","0.504991650581359863","1682095118","true","1157","2130","0","1","0","3","0","0"

Now that point is out of the way im going to start by saying i love the game, cant stop playing it, it is infuriatingly hard at this point and the devs need to sit up and take notice and sort a few small things out.

Firstly, the small red monkeys that attack every turn and gain attack every turn which then adds to the bosses overall attack either need to attack every other turn or have their health either halved or dropped by 2 points.

Secondly, the 'Aimless' enemies and mechanic in general is lopsided especially when it loses a run to pure RNG due to these style of enemies being spawned in the back and having more attack than your leader which feels awful to lose a run to as there is very very little to be done about it, a good example of these enemies would be the poison mushroom guys or the high health ox folk.

the final boss, the wizard, is imo virtually impossible unless u have a build i have yet to find, i will leave the negative review until the devs fix some of these balance issues, i dont mind losing to 'skill issues' or general poor play but RNG is a straight no when ur deep into a run and ur enemies one shot every guy u have so using ur health as a resource is a non factor and building to attrition is impossible currently.

Again the game is fantastic and im genuinely in love with it but some minor tweaks here and there and a few balance updates would be greatly appreciated","0.464049369096755981","1682086314","false","918","1255","0","25","0","2","0","0"

They all seem to agree that the game is cute and innovative and well made, but the only problem was that it was way too hard. Well, a challenge is exactly what I'm looking for, so I picked it up right away, and I'm glad I did! First off, let me be clear that the game isn't [i]that[/i] hard. I won my first three runs in a row, and at least made it to the final boss on my fourth. The game rewards careful planning and thinking ahead. Don't just do what's best for the current turn, but think about what position that will leave you in the next one or two turns, and you'll fare much better. 

If you're still struggling and want some more concrete advice:
1.[spoiler] Buy crowns from the shop. A crowned card can be played at the start of battle for free. A great way to develop your allies while also reducing RNG. [/spoiler]
2.[spoiler] Kill as many normal enemies as you can before killing the boss. You'll get more money. [/spoiler]
3.[spoiler] Milk the goblins that drop gold as much as possible. Sometimes that can even mean healing/shelling them to prolong their life. [/spoiler]","0.530201315879821777","1682069301","true","336","3527","0","3","435","4","0","0"

The game is difficult but seldom unfair, and it takes time to get use to the complexity but the game does help you by making the most of the information you'll need available all the time. The mechanic takes time to get use to and once you start getting the hang of it you'll start to see how much depth the game has and it feels very satisfying and rewarding when you play your cards right.

I do understand the complains about the balance however. There are many times where the odds are heavily stacked against me, some due to the series of poor decisions I've made up till that point, but some due to not knowing what's coming up next to prepare better. It'd be nice if we can see the Area Boss we will be up against to help drive the deck-building direction to better prepare for them. [strike]It will also be nice to have the town missions available for viewing during the run so at least if I know the run is not going to last, I can at least progress some missions.[/strike]

Overall, the game is a must-have for any deck-builder fans and the game is still in early stages so I'm hopeful that the game will improve to be much better along the way. As the game is right now, it is still an amazing game worth getting at full price for me.

This game requires you to think a lot! Like always focused and calculating all different outcomes. Its unique mechanics take some time to understand but they are so worth it. I havent beaten what I assume to be the final boss yet but I know I could. The tiring sense of dread from constantly focusing on all possible outcomes and seeing little to no good option but to see your team die off one by one. Its quite great. Feel tired from the run and cant think clearly by the end which could lead to mistakes or just wanting to surrender. Haha it sounds pretty negative but I really do enjoy this game. A true bigbrain game

UPDATE
I finished a run I had everything popping off like a well oiled machine, heals snow poison pepper, even then it came down close to the wire. But what happens after is such an amazing twist.

Pros
Great music
Great visuals
Fun mechanics 
Fun Bosses that are all unique enough to have different strategies but not so specific as to be unbeatable by a specific set upl 

Cons
Music is limited its all Great music theres just not a lot of it. or maybe because runs are so short ti feels like you hear the same song a lot but it doesnt get grating and is very catchy
The tutorial doesnt teach some basic things like how if a card dies the one behind it doesnt move around the board until after the turn. how the game decides where to put a card summoned onto the field and how it decides that.
unlockables there are not a ton of them in the game. theres maybe 5-10 cards to unlock of each type. unless of course more are added after you successfully complete a run. Thats not really a bad thing siince it means unlocking everything is totally doable. slight gripe cards are unlocked sequentially within their types. you cant just work at unlocking everything again not bad buuut the task you are assigned to unlock a card usually unlocks a card that does the thing you had to do to unlock it. buy 8 crowns at the shop unlock this bot that makes crowned characters better. it would make more sense if the last card you unlocked helped you get the next card. so that it encourages you to play and experiment with it. again minor gripe 


Overall fun game with a few minor thngs i would want fixed mainly a more flushed out tutorial to teach about spacing and summoning","0.500608980655670166","1682057396","true","588","854","0","20","0","1","0","0"

It's easy to understand, with several interesting synergies to stumble upon, and quite frankly I haven't noticed the balancing problems some of the top reviews mention.  According to the Journal I've won 9/13 games played so far, so, yeah...

And you will stumble upon those synergies, by the way.  Either out of skillfully working towards them, or out of sheer luck.  Which actually leads me to the main problem that I have with the game right now: replayability.  Perhaps I've been spoiled by the fantastic indie games that have come out over the years with a wealth of content, but as of writing this review I've played for 19 hours according to steam, including 15 runs (13 normal and 2 daily challenges) and It's getting pretty repetitive.  I just wish there was more to the game than there currently is.  I think the mechanics in the game are great, but I just want more ways of interacting with them.  More cards.  More enemies.  Just... more.

That being said, $20 for 20 hours of content isn't a bad deal or anything, hence why I'm still recommending the game.  Just, if you're looking into this game and are expecting STS levels of depth and replayability, maybe lower those expectations a bit before deciding whether it's worth it for you.  It's worth it to me, and expectations in terms of fun definitely don't need to be lowered, but I can see how that could be a problem for some.","0","1682048428","true","1179","5025","0","3","50","0","0","0"

The art style is amazing and charming and clearly has a lot of love poured into it. Each traveler you encounter feels like they have their own identity as a card and they all excel in their own categories. I love collecting all my little friends and outfitting them with they very very fun charm mechanic. 
Speaking of the charm mechanic, I cannot get enough of it. I love the gatchapon system for charms and experimenting with different charms on different cards is something I dont think I'll ever get bored of. 

All of this amazing things being said, we do have to talk about the difficulty... get gud. The game rewards experimentation and trying new things. I was finally able to win a run after about 10 hours in, which honestly felt like nothing due to all the fun I was having learning and interacting with the game. Once I got that win, I felt like I had finally mastered the mechanics and understood what makes the game so fantastic. I'm not a fan of souls-like games, but I think in that moment I finally understood what it felt like to beat and conquer a truly difficult feat and I was rewarded with one of the most insane twists I've seen in a game in a long time. I have been striving to get that second win since :)

TLDR: Wildfrost has quickly taken my heart as my favorite rogue-like with an amazing art-style, amazing mechanics, and an insane amount of charm and love this game shows off. I think once people get over the difficultly of the game, it will be held up there with Slay the Spire as the GOATS of Card-based Rogue-likes.","0","1682048391","true","736","1269","0","26","0","0","0","0"

I'm going to review this early because I bought it trying to figure out who is telling the truth from the collection of feedback I saw and after diving in its pretty obvious to me whats going wrong here as a veteran card game player.

Firstly the best way I can clearly frame this game is compared to slay the spire, slay the spire is easy to learn and go deep into a basic run and has strong player driven creativity and player difficulty control and overall slay the spire is going to, at some stage, be the harder game compared to Wildfrost. 

The problem comes with the fact that Wildfrost does a horrible job of teaching the player what does what and also scaling difficulty in a challenging yet rewarding way like slay the spire does. Firstly though the art is great but there is tons of missing on screen information that the player ought to obviously be shown. Secondly and most frustratingly and why this game has low scores the difficulty balance is total garbage for all players no matter the skill level. 

Let me list the problems with the game balance 

- Big Rng Captain card
- Big Rng Card draw including pathing
- Strange pathing RNG
- Vital charm buff RNG
- Unlock restrictions

All these hurdles are crushed into a shorten version of slay the spire which makes it painful to craft together a competent deck. You often feel like youre making the best of a pile of trash rather than enjoying building your team and their spells which is sad because the art makes you wish you could.

My first losses was just my learning stage and I didn't mind but once I got it I found I got a very powerful run going in which I smashed through all enemies very confidently. I have heard people say you need to build to counter everything and my deck had everything from good damage to great sustain. Then I get to the end boss and am met with a boss that doesnt actually represent any kind of power like say anti heal or anti attack he just straight up has massive health and massive attack surrounded by minions that buff all his stats. 

At this moment I realised ahhh so the guy who designed this is horrible at maths and it all clicked as to why so many people are frustrated with this game. The bosses and enemies I beat prior to this fight where technically harder as I had to really think about everything and act accordingly to their unique powers. But this boss was straight up a brainless pile of stats which even if I could beat would have been super boring to play against. 

Yknow anyone can have an ambitious video game idea and Im sure these guys thought they could remake slay the spire but more epic and with better graphics but they have failed entirely. Making games like this on an advanced level takes an incredibly strong level of maths because you are balancing a massive tree with thousands of possible paths. On top of that you have to make most of those paths feel like theres an enjoyable difficulty curve to them. 

Personally I cannot recommend this game as its clearly still a beta of an idea, with lots of stuff (2gbgamebtw) clearly missing and the big balance problems. Again balance not difficulty to be clear. What worries me with games like this that are released before they are ready its it makes me wonder why do that when its clearly unfinished it makes one think its unlikely the drive to truly carve the game into best form is not going to be there sadly. 

For me I don't think this game can be balanced within a tighter format than slay the spire you need lots of paths and time to give room to the player to build there decks accordingly which makes your job of balancing challenges much easier in turn. Also the trash two path system is lazy garbage an obvious mistake and I don't know why you would keep all the 3 races and so much of the base game locked.

Slay the Spire has gambling elements that scale higher the more difficult you delve but RNG is built into every single system in Wildfrost which is just plain stupid, unfun and horribly difficult to balance. The most insane thing to me is they are trying to sell this game on switch I can tell you right now the average 13 year old switch user is going to fkin hate this game haha what the damn were you thinking. This game needed to be strongly community tested via steam Early Access because its a cool ambitious idea you are basically trying to make a more complex version of slay the spire. 

Games like MonsterTrain and RogueBook took the slay the spire format and gave it a small boost in complexity they didnt get over ambitious with their system and it allowed them to craft great games. What is here is a mess and I think frankly if you want a challenge stick with Slay the Spire and if you want some fun go for Roguebook. 

Overall I do see that even the devs acknowledge the balance issues but the level of communication is trash don't post vague tiny paragraphs it makes you look clueless which frankly you clearly are. To save you some pain please just listen to the steam community they will help you fix this garbage much faster than you can alone if you are even capable. Trust me I have seen this happen so many many times and I do like the concepts here but they need a ton more time in workshop to truly shine. So please pls cancel this ridiculous switch launch and focus on making this game great for the next 6 months and it could grow into a game as legendary as slay the spire. 

Currently Wildfrost is an ambitious mess frozen in the form of a unfulfilling beta that only dev transparency and the truthful fires of the steam community can fix and I really pray they allow this game idea to flourish. Simply fire your clueless card math guy and let the community fix your game, they already have make great suggestions. Ignore gamers and this game will be forgotten within a year mark my words.","0.450854748487472534","1682041043","false","187","718","0","197","0","7","1","0"

It can also be hard to wrap your head around a long chain reaction of a turn (that can lead to a mistake.)


With that said, the game started working a lot in my favor when I started playing the way it wanted me to play it:

• Teams are WAY stronger with dynamic & balanced Tanks and DPS, instead of rolling for one-note glass cannons.
• Each run can be short and bad luck can force you to lose, but taking time on a single run got me more wins than playing multiple runs loosely (hoping for good cards/charms.)
• The 'challenge bells' are (I assume) the way the game is meant to be played and its buffs actually make the game easier once you get a sense of the card pool.


Beautiful game. Its difficulty became a lot more palatable once I realized one of its solutions was to unlearn a lot of my old habits from other deck builders and roguelikes. At some point maybe a mod can add an undo button or a prediction system that could make it more accessible.","0","1682033922","true","1570","8199","0","11","411","0","0","0"

The fact that the game is so challenging is a plus to me - it makes you work for successful runs, and once things 'click' it's really incredibly satisfying to build up highly varied powerhouse teams!","0","1682032837","true","1304","3442","0","3","0","0","0","0"

The art is incredible, the music slaps, and the gameplay feels refined, tactile, and amazingly satisfying. Much of this game's criticism centers around its difficulty, and while it is true that it is quite difficult, I find that it is not too difficult (or if it is maybe I'm just a masochist--who knows?). There might be some balancing work to be done, but the unique counter system combined with playing cards from a hand feels, as I said early, just so satisfying. I really love the meta progression as well--watching your home base get built up and looking at the new, pretty cards you unlock is great. 
Also, the developers clearly have a sense of humor, and the whole game just gives off an incredible, nintendo-esk lightheard feel (I mean that in the best possible way since I love the comfortable feeling many nintendo games have).

That being said, yes, it feels pretty difficult at first because there are a lot of mechanics being thrown at you all at once in the first run-through, and you might get put up against something that counters you in later areas. Honestly though, it's doable. I've only played that game one time so far and I was able to run through the entire thing in one go. This isn't a humble brag or anything, it's just to say, this game is great at making you think outside the box. 

I found that, even with the one frost stack per turn resistance on enemies, it was very powerful combo'd with the card with the mallet (I forget it's name), the one that deals base 4 damage and an extra 8 to frosted enemies. Crowns are a must buy from the shop because determining what cards you start your turn with is strong in any deck-builder, rogue-lite or not. The charms all seemed pretty unique as well. 

Honestly, as far as deck building rogue-lites go, I really do think this one is a good balance of difficulty and strategy. With a lot of them, half the time it feels like you either have a deck sent from the heavens or you can't get past the second stages. Or, if you do get past them, the final boss is something that stomps any deck that isn't, as previously stated, sent from the heavens. At no point in this game did I feel like my deck was massively overpowered, nor did I feel like it was absolutely hopeless. I felt like I needed to think and strategize before almost every move. I can't wait to try out other deck types besides frost, it seems like a well rounded game with a fun mix-up of abilities!","0","1682025383","true","87","87","0","1","118","0","0","0"

You'll die a lot in this game, especially if you're bad like me or make a mistake but it's always fun and I never mind restarting because every run is a new experience right from the get go.

Pro's:
- Amazing artstyle
- Great music
- I love the gameplay and the possible synergies between builds.

Con's:
- The game is brutally difficult for it's artstyle. I've been used to it since Caveblazers, and it's a game where losing is part of the progress.
- there are some waves of enemies that have some of their own synergy builds as well, some of which that can directly counter your build, it's hard to tell if that's by lack of experience or by choosing the wrong options to make my build. 
Tough, sometimes the build you want is not guaranteed to happen, (because that would be broken.) But it's important to adapt to what's currently possible.

I do not see the reason to dislike the game. (Except maybe for a certain funny seafood)
The short sessions makes up for the harder difficulity, and discovering a new build each run keeps it refreshing.
It's a charming and tactical gem, and I see a lot of potentional in the future with it.","0.489830523729324341","1681415318","true","60","9395","0","56","66","0","0","0"

I'm now writing this review immediately after completing my first run, in which I won. Zero meta progression, zero upgrades, blindly encountering the mechanics of the game and following the tutorial opening. It appears to be a false ending which I'm guessing is a part of the meta progression of the game, but regardless, I was very surprised given my expectations going in.

My guess for all the negativity around difficulty is that fundamentally, this game is not like the majority of deckbuilders. The action economy is different, the tactics are different, planning out turns ahead of time is different due to the count-down counter system and positioning of your cards. You don't just slam a bunch of cards down and win with your 'BRRR' deck like in 99% of other deckbuilders.

I'm writing this review because the developers do not deserve the negative reviews for a game that is as [b] beautifully polished, aesthetically charming, and fun to play [/b] even without me experiencing any of the meta progression.

Because of this I've felt great when I pieced things together for a good run.

Also, slowly making progress is made more enjoyable by the unlock system- I can slowly unlock more and more things just by completing various goals or challenges.

The game has a great replay value with no runs being the same yet knowledge from previous runs is highly applicable allowing for a rewarding experience as you learn more. The game is great for beginners to the card based strategy game genre, it allows anyone regardless of experience to feel a sense of progression as they play with simple yet in depth mechanics to provide a great experience for veterans and new players alike. One thing about the game that has resulted in many negative reviews for the game is the balancing of bosses, some bosses that can appear at the same stage in the game have vastly different difficulty and many people dislike the difficulty of the stronger boss and calling it unfair, i disagree with this however as the boss is challenging but can be beat as long as you know what to do, and with them appearing at the start, does not result in a long run ending due a lack of knowledge. Rather than the boss being too difficult i wish that the other one was instead stronger as while it was great as a tutorial boss, it was easily beatable and provides little challenge. Overall a great game that is a welcome addition to the card strategy genre.","0","1682013745","true","463","674","0","1","31","0","0","0"

As of writing this review I've successfully completed 1 run (about 7 hours of playtime and maybe 10-12 runs).
For me this is a really fun roguelike unlike anything I have played before.

The game has a steep learning curve and the process of figuring things out was a lot of fun. I still wouldn't say that I've mastered everything but I'm starting to consistently make it to the last area. You're probably going to lose a lot, so prepare yourself for that and try to learn as much as you can each run.

There are two gripes that I would say is holding the game back at the moment. 
The first is that I would like more enemy variety. Don't get me wrong, it's certainly not bad at the moment. But after a few runs you start to notice what boss comes when, I think each boss slot has 2 possibilities except for a few key boss battles. One more possibility for each would have been nice.
UPDATE: So apparently there were additional variations I hadn't seen yet, I just haven't gotten them in a run until 15 hours in and even there I know there is one boss variant I haven't seen. I don't know if there were prerequisites to see them or if it's just bad RNG. Either way this gripe isn't valid for me anymore.

The second is that you don't really get to choose what cards you start with. When you start a new run the cards you start with is tied to the tribe of the leader you pick. Outside of not being able to choose cards to bring initially however, you do have a lot of control over this after.

These two gripes above are relatively minor for the price of the game and the game still provides you with options to choose from throughout the entire run, from start to finish.

I've had a lot of fun and am satisfied with this game.","0","1681549784","true","427","4372","68","32","639","0","0","0"

Also, the tutorial deck seems extra week.. and the game is sort of hard. Which is to say, its fine being hard, but its going to require some turn order thinking, not just being a cakewalk. Many games and in this genre, the first couple runs are easier, give you a bit of a break, and then you get creamed. In this game, you'll get creamed much faster, before you get too many extra cards, if you're not thinking a bit. You'll get lots of cards given to you if you hang on for a fight or two, but every fight is a challenge. So, if you want a game that is rewarding (and yet has some RNG pain), this seems a pretty solid follow up to the wonders of StS and Monster Train. But if you want an easy game where you win 75% of the time by just coasting through, this is not that. For StSD (Slay the Spire) you need to think to do well, but just bombing through you'll do okay.

Although the game appealed to him, controversy surrounding the game's difficulty and negative reviews put into question whether or not it'd be a worthwhile purchase for him to make. I mean, why buy a game you didn't enjoy playing/ would find too stressful, right? So he asked for my opinion of the game.

Taking the time to look into what was in store for anyone desiring to play this deck builder (from video reviews and a few runs through the game), I found myself also engrossed in the concept of play (reminiscent of Monster Train - by the same people that created Slay the Spire), the art style, music, and overall theming that encapsulated Wildfrost. As someone that loves deck builders, it didn't take long before I decided that I needed a copy of the game for myself.

As of the time of writing this, I've had one run of the game, and this first run was a victory. Yet I've read that some individuals have struggled against the first bosses they've come across... This is purely my opinion, so don't take my words for more than what they are; words. If you've played deck builders or any assortment of strategy game before, you know that there is always something of a learning curve. There are mechanics to learn, enemies and synergies to grow accustomed to, risks to weigh out, and if you aren't consciously thinking about your choices, all it takes is a few bad moves to lose. Not everyone who walks into a deck builder or strategy game is prepared with this sort of mentality though. So in fairness, I can see why anyone would find themselves frustrated with a game alike from Wildfrost. Strategy games have their own form of challenge to them, but that's what I feel is satisfying about them. Whether it's problem solving your way to victory, making crazy combos to take down tough foes, or even finding that your plans didn't pan out how you hoped they had. There is experience to be gained and enjoyment to be had.

I believe the game to be a love letter to anyone who enjoys the deck building genre. The game has endless replayability, scaling challenges (in part determined by the player's victories), numerous strategies to build upon, it feels good to play, and is a unique experience.

If you are concerned about being 'bad', please don't let that dictate the enjoyment that you may have. Consider that failure and overcoming challenges is cause for growth, and you'll get better at anything, so long as you don't shirk the fact that we all at times will fail. If you read this and haven't done so, perhaps take the time to watch a few videos of the gameplay too, just to better judge if the game is for you :)

But this is actually more of a puzzle game where you sort of have to change how you play to beat each boss/etc..

The game does require you to stop and think carefully about the outcome of your play every single turn, so if you're just looking for a game where you can simply sling cards out of your hand, you might have a frustrating time with this game, because the addition of rows and positional effects alongside the tried and true card battler roguelike experience make every turn potentially widely open as to what the 'next best' move is, some boss battles might end in as little as 10 turns, but you might need to spend a couple minutes thinking each of those 10 turns carefully and planning ahead a few turns in advance so that you're not ambushed by playing the wrong card 2 turns ago.

I love card games, played a lot of slay the spire, into the breach, paper card games, other roguelikes and strategy games. To me the game felt even almost a bit too easy, I was able to have a successful full run with 2 out of the 3 factions in my first two times playing with them, so don't be too intimidated by any reviews saying the game is difficult, if you're willing to spend a couple minutes per turn strategizing on your win conditions, then you're likely to succeed more often than not.

As for unlockabled and progression, the game feels a bit slim at the moment, there's a few things to unlock and a few challenges and achievements to work towards, but overall it doesn't feel like they drastically change your gaming experience. Regardless, if you're mediocrely skilled at card roguelikes you're likely to still get at least a good 20 hours of enjoyment from the base game, and then maybe try some wacky things or get extra enjoyment from the daily runs. Definitely worth picking up for the hardcore fans of the genre who like card battlers that force them to think their turns carefully.","0","1681989260","true","674","837","0","10","0","0","0","1"

Essentially, you have a short 'Pirates!'-like map to walk through for 2-3 additional cards for each play through, to customize a deck. You also earn points/coins to unlock things unnecessarily to give an illusion progress through what is otherwise a loot-box-like mechanic. Boring. 

Each play through any character or primary card you used is essentially deleted; you start over and get a random assortment of things to pick through making the difficulty curve go up, but go up its artificially induced as the player cannot pick any mechanics towards their own play styles, strengths or otherwise offer any choice. Instead, the game itself _randomly_ picks the playstyle needed for that specific instance necessitating unnecessarily long chains for familiarity to the mechanics. Speaking of: Some mechanics are insanely powerful; if you play those mechanics yourself, great. If you find an enemy with them, well, enjoy -- like the AoE acid drops that tick each turn.

TL;DR: Imagine playing 'Random Heroes' on Overwatch being the only mode to learn the game, and lootboxes were required to unlock features of heroes. Difficult? Sure. Respectful to the player or rewarding? No.","0.479963988065719604","1681984832","false","108","108","0","9","0","3","0","0"

I wonder if the people struggling with the game are focusing too much on the cards and forgetting that units can be moved or recalled for free, which is *very* important.

I'd recommend focusing on getting 2 companions early, buying crowns, and putting companions in play as early as possible.

Basically, there are cards (heroes and companions) that activate every 'X' number of turns once they are played onto the battle area. Then to control who your cards attack, who they get attacked by, and which of your cards are the targets of your boon cards, you get to freely move them into different positions on the battle area each turn. There are also 'direct action' cards which have their effect immediately on the target - such as an attack or healing card.

Since the game plays differently than other card battlers it can take some getting used to, but I did win my 4th run so it isn't crazy hard. That is much faster than I won Slay the Spire or Monster Train.

Notable innovations to the card-battler genre from an artistic and mechanical standpoint. Board positioning is essential, as is paying attention to the minute details of enemy effects and attack patterns.

This game is extremely punishing, and for me that is very motivating to keep playing. This is not a game where you can afford to zone out, and it holds tension even in the early battles of each run.

- Allow re-rolling of hero selections

In a refreshing twist on card based roguelites the game relies primarily on a delayed activation mechanic whereby enemies and friendly units count down each time a card is played, firing their effect off when the counter reaches 0.

It then further complicates this already quite interesting puzzle by including the ability to rearrange your own board at will, even recalling some cards to your discard pile making space, removing dangerous debuffs, and healing them.

What you're left with is a game that demands a lot of attention, since each card can potentially be interacting with 12 others (6 slots for both you and the enemy) with each activation triggered potentially triggering reaction activation or applying effects there are very few simple hands to play. Consequently the game can be quite difficult as you're coming to grips with it but it isn't unpredictable. Decks are small and actions are almost entirely deterministically resolved.

Tops off this refreshingly innovative game with some absolutely gorgeous (and diverse!) art and fantastic sound design as well as a real life friendly quit and resume function and I have very few criticisms.

I also had difficulty completing some achievements that should have been easy, but it seems that without the right combination of cards, they are impossible.

- Amazing art style, incredibly cute
- Music is a bop after bop
- Deep gameplay systems
- Satisfying to learn - enemy tropes, pickable cards, combo scoring, trigger order - keeping all this in mind will let you get those win streaks

- No option to pet any of the cute characters, absolutely criminal
- The ordering of some abilities is inconsistent
- I wish there were more enemies, they feel a bit repetitive after 20 runs

As for the people who found this game too hard, I think they might have thought that this game would be easier due to its cute exterior. If you lose concentration or misunderstand mechanics, it can feel like you lost out of the blue.

I can understand people's frustration with the difficulty, as it's never nice to feel like you straight up suck at a game for reasons beyond your control - but much like my first god knows how many hours in StS, it more often turns out that you just don't know how to play the game, and given this isn't just about get cards and play them, I think a lot of people are messing up the tactical side.

I'm 6 hours in and have beaten the end boss once, and have made it back to them twice since, and I've only really been trying out one type of 'class' but even within that 'class' there's so many sub-builds to go for that I really feel like I'm just sort of scratching the surface of the content.

It can be tough, but I honestly don't think it's any tougher than similar games like Slay the Spire, albeit for different reasons - the combat in this game requires planning, positioning, and card juggling to walk away from each battle victorious, vs say StS where it's pure deck management, so it's really a very impressive and I feel innovative take on the genre, and I really look forward to whatever else they have lined up.","0.523809552192687988","1681943215","true","354","1134","0","27","0","1","0","0"

It shares some pretty beefy challenge, but once you've got a hang on mechanics and know what to expect from enemies & bosses you'll have the knowledge to prepare yourself properly with what the game gives you. Sometimes RNG isn't kind but you just gotta roll with the punches.

As some general tips to help curb some of the difficulty, don't pigeonhole yourself into picking cards from an archetype after your first treasure/companion pull - consider everything in context! You might see a fun scaling card for the one mushrooms guy you have, but if you can't put out enough damage to deal with the enemies at pace you're gonna die before you have anything to scale. Or you might already have a really solid setup to start stacking stats on one of your multi-attack units - awesome! But you're just outside the ice caves, and what're you gonna do if you run into the cats with thorns on them? Do you have an answer to that? Maybe you're better off picking up a damage item than another stat boost card.

And remember you can pull your cards off the battlefield to restore their health, avoid otherwise unavoidable damage and remove debuffs. Generally I avoid the money caves until after the first/second boss, reasoning that if you don't have the cards/charms to be strong enough to beat the boss, you won't make it to the next shop to spend your money.","0","1681940785","true","895","2051","0","12","173","0","0","0"

Gorgeous art, wonderful music, super unique gameplay that mixes a cool take on auto battling with more traditional deck builder structure, I personally love the lack of continuous HP throughout a run (every single battle is life or death).

Update: I'd like to change this review a bit now that I've got some more hours under my belt. Buckle up for some words.

This game is incredibly fair, even more than I previously thought. I've got 22 hours now, 34 runs in that time and a 38% winrate (including 3 true wins).

There is tons of variety and the degree by which card acquisition is limited feels totally fine and is honestly necessary to prevent the player from becoming too strong with synergies. There is almost no randomness once within an encounter, only which lanes enemies deploy to, which charms they spawn with, card draw (obviously), and where aimless attacks go. This means you can nearly math out an entire encounter and determine whether or not your current line will work before committing to it.

The [spoiler] 'final boss' [/spoiler] mechanic has gotten some criticism, including from me initially. But after confronting it a good number of times I can honestly say it feels incredibly fair. [spoiler] It may be your previously winning team you are fighting with extra stats, so hypothetically it is very strong, but they cannot move around, they do not have spells, and you maintain full control over every single turn. [/spoiler] It is maybe the first time I've been happy with this style of mechanic in a roguelike.

The only possible balance complaint I have is teeth is too strong on enemies, the numbers are just too high in my opinion. With enemies coming in with charms sometimes they can have 4 teeth on spawn, which is often enough to two shot your hero, who cannot be recalled. In particular the Marrow and Smog encounter in particular feels terrible and I absolutely dread getting it.

On one hand, it’s a clean, smooth, roguelite in-run deckbuilder (none of that pre-construction dated systems), that is also well loved by its artists.
But on the other hand, it’s mildly shallow in some areas from a content perspective.

[b]To start, the game is great in the sense that it’s difficult.[/b] It’s similar to slay the spire in that way, to all the people complaining about not winning, think about how long it actually took you to get a hang of darkest dungeon, or how long it took you to actually win your first runs in slay the spire. It’s no different in that it takes careful play and a little bit of luck during construction.
Another groovy feature is the Rng of building your decks, starting with a randomized leader is huge, as well as charms and random cards/companions in that order.
This game has smooth gameplay, lovely art, fun Rng deckbuilding, engaging difficulty, and isn’t a terribly huge price tag.

As for what it lacks/can improve on, starting with a nit pick, the traveling map seems decently bland and could use a revamp or touch up with more things in the background and/or a visual that surrounds the paths (think of the spire, from slay the spire, a big rectangle the player is trapped to progress in) as the current one feels like a soft pencil on cardboard.
As another nit pick, it would be nice to see something more like the events system that these games tend to use, mainly just an aspect of Rng for road events to spice up the traveling decisions, or at least a greater variety of stops, and/or variety of cards/charms.
Nit pick aside, the lacking of content I was here to talk about. I know it’s a broad statement, but the game seemingly could use some more quantities, seeing how it is a deckbuilder. For what we have, we could use more effects in the game that most clans can use, like for example perhaps slight variations like pierce through with does damage through the front unit, or perhaps a effect that allows you to aim your attacks of a being. Mainly just more tiny or big variations to truly make it feel like there is vast amount of leader abilities, effects to put on cards, the cards themselves, and a small assortment of companions/cards that are perhaps generated like the leaders (think like the Nintendo mii character, amongst the smash bro roster).

[strike]Additionally, enemies seemingly are too orderly, it would be more interesting to see smaller fights that are randomized from a tier of enemies much like slay the spire, while the bosses remain at the end. If there isn’t already, ascensions in difficulty would automatically lift up this deckbuilder roguelite, it’s kinda a win more in terms of game longevity and if development time permits it, kinda a no brainer for these types of games.[/strike] (Edit: there is a modifier system, could be nice and addresses most of this, but perhaps it ought to go even further beyond after a second win?)
Lastly, I would also recommend a modifier or relic-like system where you can get game changing items that effect everything. We already have the boss rewards granting “relics”, why not add in a bit more variety, perhaps even as a buildable building.

Anyways, as much as I have stuff to say about improving the game, it is a fun experience, you can chose to retire the game in content development and it would still be alright, but there is definitely some potential to improve upon the vibrancy in the variety.","0.503733634948730469","1681427085","true","154","1017","0","56","0","1","0","0"

People leaving reviews that they couldnt beat the first encounter in anything over 3 tries have got to be trolling. my vegetated grandmother could figure it out. i think the game has enough different playstyles per faction that all feel good and satisfying to play and picking a starting character often feels great and i have yet to feel like 'aw man this character looks strong but i hate that faction' which i think is extremely impressive. 

Overall, this game is extremely good and definitely needs to be played to really see if youll like it or not. if youre on the fence, remember that steam has a full refund policy below 2 hours of playtime. if you give it a shot and youre not a fan you can go to the steam support website, log into your account, and request a refund. I think its absolutely worth trying for yourself because underneath a layer of mechanics to learn is a really cool and fun experience. definitely my favorite deckbuilder ive played thus far.

While I do believe that there is a bit of a difficulty spike between acts 1 and 2, the game all around is balanced pretty decently if not a bit rng heavy. Snowballing and shuffling units into the deck are the most important aspects of the game and once you realize that the game becomes a lot more manageable. It takes a while to get used to but all around it's pretty fun. Though I still don't like how the town progression kind of forces you down specific choices during runs. Plus the fact that runs are so short means that some strategies can't work since you need cards that help you in the moment. All around a fun experience and I apologize for judging this game a bit early.","0","1681375943","true","155","673","0","12","0","0","0","1"

What's letting it down is that 95% of the time I die by 'not noticing something'.

99% of the negative reviews will be due to this design choice, I think.

What I feel is missing:
- Indicators telling you which cards are about to die (changing as you select your card)
- Icons/warnings against misclicks (can turn off in options)
- The ability to make your card movements after placing one

I'm incrementally getting better at handling each of these, but so far 4 out of 5 deaths feel cheap. The system is beautifully designed with great combo potential and depth, but for whatever odd reason 'reading the game state' is obliquely presented as part of the skill. I love planning out my deck, building cards, adapting in battle to new circumstances. The game has plenty of strengths but hides them behind a GOTCHA approach to ending your runs.

Why is this design issue a problem?
- There are many, many things to check each time you play a card (health stats, timers, buffs, etc). Effects can chain together so this is a long checklist that you keep wanting to shortcut.
- I can't play at pace and enter a flow state. It puts the breaks on, and nothing else about the game design suggests this is a slow paced tactical game.
- Almost every failure was avoidable on that turn. Your ideas weren't wrong, you just missed something.

I still recommend this game. It's complex and beautiful, but there's no absolutely need to have HA HA YOU DIDN'T SEE THAT as part of the 'difficulty'. Physical games have that. It's a mistake in digital card games of this complexity, and was the best thing Slay the Spire ever did for the genre.

It's insane that some people are dismissing the game as unbalanced or too difficult after a few hours' playtime. Personally I haven't felt game being particularly unbalanced, even with added difficulty from the first two [spoiler]cursed bells[/spoiler]. You really have to think your moves ahead or things can get out of hand real fast. There is indeed a lot of to keep track of in the battles, and it's one of the things I think makes the game especially engaging. As others have stated, there's very little room for misplays.

Another gripe I've seen people having is there not being enough viable builds. First of all, in a game like this you can't except to win every time, especially in the beginning. It will take some time to learn which cards, companions and effects synergize well and how to build your deck. I feel this game actually offers more leeway with your deck than some other deckbuilders I've played. Only a couple of times I've felt I've gotten a lousy selection of cards. Most of the time I have to think of which card to pick because they all fit in my deck in some way.

If you're still on the fence just watch someone play the game. If you find yourself facepalming at the player's misplays buy the game.","0","1681931080","true","494","1080","0","5","0","0","0","0"

The other hard part was not paying enough attention and suddenly losing the whole run which feels really bad, a potenial solution is a incoming damage indicator like monster train has
Pros:
Cute unique art style, really fun gamepaly, good meta progression, and slick UI
Cons:
The lack of incoming damage indicator (like monster train)

Love the artwork, music, and gameplay.
Card placement in battle adds another level of strategy beyond building a deck.
While the difficulty of the game is high, it doesn't feel unbalanced.
When I lost, I felt like it was because of my own mistakes, not game balance.
I was able to get my first victory on my second day of playing.
This unlocked a feature to further increase game difficulty if desired.

I have three main factions unlocked right now and they all feel unique and fun to play with.
I'm looking forward to trying out a variety of strategies based on my faction, leader, companions, and cards I find along the way!

One thing to note, don't go into this game expecting the exact same type of play style as Slay the Spire.
In Slay the Spire you are able to play multiple cards a turn, sometimes going infinite.
Wildfrost is more tactical based.
After every card played, the attack counter on all allies and enemies goes down.
As such, you need to choose what card to play carefully and prepare for enemy attacks a number of turns in advance.
Before enemies attack, choosing what allies will take the hit is key.
When you attack, choosing what enemy to attack is equally important.

I don't agree with reviews that are saying the game is unbalanced.

For people who are considering the question of difficulty; if you are into the genre and played StS, Monster Train, Inscryption etc: This game is absolutely not too hard or even unbalanced. It requires you to learn and understand the mechanics and act strategically - as is standard in the genre. If you like those other games, please give this one a try, it is well worth it. 

As a game designer myself I can confidently say that many of Wildfrosts ideas and spins feel exciting and new. I love how the team tackled the issue of card cost in conjunction with the snow mechanic and how they managed to come up with so many inventive mechanics in a genre that is already filled with so many great ones (Overburn and Bom specifically).

My only caveat with the game would be its limited length and encounter variety. While every encounter feels very unique and challenging at first, after about twenty to thirty runs I have the feeling that I know every enemy by heart.","0","1681926374","true","1019","4696","0","5","0","0","0","1"

Early on you may build up your deck in a way that just gets hard countered by a boss encounter. But due to the nature of the game, starting another run and moving on isn't too frustrating. Lots of cool interactions and a set of mechanics that make it easy to see where you can build up to strong combos. Along with a pleasing art style and a snappy interface, Wildfrost is a fun game that is certainly worth the price. 

If you're a fan of rogue-likes and other deck builders, you won't find this game being out of your wheelhouse.","0","1681920212","true","1460","3429","0","2","435","1","0","0"

Then proceeded to play it in all my off time for the next two days. I just meant to play a run or two, and now I am about 20 runs deep. So in short its good.

The game is hard, definitely, but is it unfair? or unbalanced? no. 60% of the time I die to my misplays/not realising what the enemy is about to do, the rest i die due to facing a enemy team which counters my build. But at the end of the day that doesnt matter, I like being forced to carefully think each move, and calculate all the variables in each little turn, and the future of each fight. But I absolutely love all the broken nonsense the game lets you do, without letting everything become a cake walk.

The game is difficult--no doubt about it. But, for me, I think that difficulty comes from the differences between this game and others I've played. The counter switches things up. It gives you a lot more to think about, but also a lot more warning about what's coming. Right now, I appreciate the struggle.

After less than 5 hours of playtime I got my first win and was really close even around 3 hours in. I can confidentiliy say that if you have experience with Slay The Spire or any strategy rouglike this game is not too difficult to learn.

I will say however, that the game is extremely punishing of mistakes. In several instances I have lost a run for simply playing two cards in different order than was optimal or moving a unit one turn too early/late. With that said, I do not thing the skill floor is necissarily higher in this game compared to other strategy rougelikes. There are also scenarios where I feel absolutely hopeless and some fights are unwinnable. From my experience in Slay The Spire I know that it often is not due to the game being designed poorly, but simply my prior actions lead to me having an unwinnable fight - picking wrong cards or paths. 

Even if the game would be concidered too difficult, I absolutely think it is worth playing. The game design is very unique despite borrowing many of its mechanics from other games. (Also the game looks and sound amazing in my opinion). 

I highly recommend to give it a try for anyone who likes strategy roguelikes. It truly is an amazing game.","0","1681917042","true","284","2548","0","13","0","1","0","0"

What I don't really like is that the choices in between boss battles are rather limited, which leads to picking similar builds and screws you over early if you don't get a nice combo. I also don't understand why a new wave immediately spawns after killing all the enemies while the wave counter is still 2+. As it stands the game forces me to stall out killing the last enemy so I can make some preperations for the next wave, which is just an odd mechanic.","0","1681914218","true","400","4257","0","12","0","1","0","0"

While not easy, you know exactly what every character is going to do at all times. The only unpredictable aspect is new enemies spawning, but you are given a counter to let you know when they will appear. 
Knowing in advance, what will happen allows strategic play with foresight, setting up 3-4 turns in advance - to balance the amount of information given to you, mistakes are punished severely and quickly. Successfully beating a battle feels all the more rewarding as a result.

Playing the demo during the next fest I immediately knew this would be one of my favorite deckbuilders. Wildfrost is a fantastic game that imo really elevates the genre.

There's a level of polish in this game that's several steps above the competition. The art, animations and soundtrack are top notch and result in the game feeling super smooth.

This level of polish is also apparent in its mechanics, the game boasts a set of very simple cards using several relatively simple keywords that all strongly fit the game themes and still present a lot of strategic depth when combined together.
The tactical element is also a big part of what makes the game unique and so enjoyable, and also, I assume, why so many steam reviewers are struggling with it. Every encounter is built to be challenging (there's no filler small encounter like you'd find in StS) and you have a lot of decision to make every turn as you can freely rearrange your units before you play a card, allowing you to choose who will take hits and/or dish back.
Being limited to one card a turn and the enemies being dangerous also means the game is very punishing, often one mistake will be enough to end the run even when you have a great build, alternatively it also means wins are very achievable with mediocre ones if you play correctly.
Personally I found this to give it a great learning curve which really fits the lower amount of encounters (and run time) but I can definitely understand it being frustrating if you're used to simply winning with strong decks in other deckbuilders.
The game handles progression in a way I adore, there's no straight meta upgrades like in Hades or most roguelites nowadays, simply variety unlocks a la Isaac to complexify the game as you go, it's even done in a similar manner as the unlocks are achievements based, giving you reasons to pick up unusual builds and great replayability.

The game still has some pitfalls however, I found that despite most builds being viable, they often end up feeling similar as you look for the same things to make them work (multi-strikes, barrage...). There's also one specific encounter that will always require 5D thinking and still be dependant on RNG (the aimless + teeth one) which can be pretty tiring. The game also doesn't have enough variety in its encounters in general.

Still, after 22 hours and beating the final boss on the highest difficulty, I'm really happy about my experience with Wildfrost and will definitely eventually be back to grab the rest of the unlocks. Highly recommended to anyone familiar with the genre who's not afraid of a challenge.

Ahh well then that ability you didn't read quite right or that you didn't see coming will still kill them! Watch the counters carefully and oops, you missed one! congrats you just lost. Sorry! The cards really are just a way of managing relatively static abilities your faction has or does not have access to on any given turn and after a series of turns you get to 'reset' that assortment of abilities. 

2.) If you're lucky you might add 5 or so cards (aside 2-3 companions) to your deck during the run and perhaps upgrade 3 or 4 of those with charms. You are entirely at the mercy of RNG on if those cards will be good enough to deal with the baddies. While there are 3 factions and those decks are 'different' you will have to painfully lose for a while before you can unlock them. Sorry!

3.) Speaking of Baddies some of them are hideously overpowered for the 'average deck' you will lose 9 out of 10 runs and almost always before getting to the final fight. The creatures ramp up in difficulty rather quickly. Expect failure and not the sort you learn from - many of these fights and battles you just can't win from the onset. Sorry!

It took 13 runs at about 16 hours before I completed one 'win'. For the average person that's probably 8 sessions and for the more dedicated 3 or 4. Spending 92% of the time you play losing is not really an enjoyable game loop. Everyone will have a different preference to how often they'd like to succeed or fail. I am astonished that the default setting is so brutal.

Some other notes for the devs: 
Please have something in the user interface alert you that your hero is imminently going to die based on the current game state. Knowing you are 'in check' would be a pretty helpful quality of life feature. 

Renaming cards is super cool! But...why doesn't it retain what I named them between sessions? After the 3rd session I stopped renaming cards because I was just going to have to do it again and again and again.

I don't normally put in reviews, however there have been mixed opinions on the difficulty of the game. I will say that this game demands you to pay attention, as one misplay can cost you the run. You will have to familiarise yourself with the new mechanics as you play - Recalling your companions, Card synergies, Repositioning the cards on the board etc. And that is what makes it even more fun, the discovery and learning process. Later on in the game, you can unlock huts that help counteract the RNG and improve your deck substantially.

The deck building and battle gameplay feel a lot like Slay the Spire and especially Inscryption, so if you enjoyed those and enjoy challenging games you'll probably like this one. There's a variety of different mechanics that make you think very thoughtfully both about how you play a given round in combat and how you build your deck, and the art, music, and effects are all great. Boggling how it's at mixed reviews, usually I look at Steam reviews for an indication of how good a game (generally ignoring a game at or below mostly positive), but this game definitely has me rethinking that a bit.

The game is difficult but fair. Similar to other games like Slay the Spire, getting gud means having an understanding of what enemy encounters you might run up against that can only come from experiencing them. Counting one strategy too much can be your downfall when you come up against a new encounter that counters you in an unexpected way. I found it fun to lose to certain combats but then build my next run to avoid the same failure, however can see how others might see it to be frustrating.","0","1681780198","true","841","1237","0","2","0","0","0","1"

The obvious comparison that people point towards with this game is Slay the Spire. I'd argue this game is more akin to Into the Breach. In the sense that your mistakes are felt immediately. I'm sorry, but Slay the Spire is not a difficult game and a little bit mindless. In the sense you just shit out cards in your turn and left click on any card that has key text that matches cards you have in your deck. Mistakes in Slay the Spire are not that big of a deal, they'll slowly add up into a punishment, which is felt. However, this is generally a gradual curve that gets steeper as you progress through the ascension mechanic. 

When it comes to games like Wildfrost or Into the Breach, you make a misplay? 1-2 Turns, it is literally fucking over for you. People in general tend to be pretty bad at spotting their own misplays(which is why game coaching is a thing). Mistakes don't tend to be obvious unless you have a third-party judging or you re-watch a replay. I think this is the core reason why this game is largely going to be frustrating for most people. Obviously, nobody intentionally misplays, you did that play, because you assumed it was the best play.

This game HEAVILY rewards foresight, maybe my hand has some units that I want to pop on the field and some direct damage cards. The enemy board has a couple cronies, but the looming threat of the 10/8 snowman jabroni lose 0/-1 when hit is there on a 4-turn counter. My reroll meter is at 3, MAYBE I should slam my 4/3 6-turn counter healing pet. Or maybe I say, well that's basically a turn skip as this is not going to provide value, except on the 10/2 boss, which is basically a free kill. Maybe I should consider not greeding for a free reroll and slam it now, knowing that since my hand has no freeze cards and we're in early game. I basically have a 99% probability of hitting at least one minimum which can delay the 10/8 snowman. 

If you're not really familiar with this level of foresight in strategy games, yeah it's going to suck. If you've played games that required this level of foresight, you will adapt much quicker than someone else due to built-up [i]'muscle memory'[/i] and likely consistently get to the final boss.

My big assumption for why people are losing is due to the fact they are scared and want to protect their little hero and so the enemy just does an insane combo and one-turn wipes your board and it's ggwraps. Hero health in this game is treated the exact same as it is in Hearthstone, it is a resource. Meaning do NOT be scared to use your hero as a tank. If your hero has enough health to survive and the damage against it does not exceed 3/4 for every attack instance against it. I BETTER see you throwing that mf in the front lines to soak. I've noticed based on my playstyle, that I NEVER and I mean LITERALLY never recall my units. If I can get pretty far by gimping myself, you can too.

Now I know this sounds like this game is hyper-strategic, notebook, pen and paper, write down turn orders and exact calculations for 10 turns in advance, 5D CHESS. It’s really not that deep, every game is super short and once you get pretty good at it, you can think about these things while going through the motions of repositioning + playing something from your hand very quickly. Every run is short as shit as well. You only have to do 8[spoiler]+ 1[/spoiler] fights. You know those gimme fights in Slay the Spire in-between elites and bosses? Yeah imagine just all of those were removed and their severity was multiplied. This can be a good or a bad thing for most people, some people like that slow methodical progression. Some people think that going through a 2-3 minute instance that you’re obviously going to win is just fluff. I definitely agree with the later, I’m not a fan and I’d rather have a condensed experience. However, this is important to note in the overall, “why am I being humbled?” A game winning run will unironically take 30-40 minutes. Compared to Slay the Spire which is like 60-100 minutes… on a good day.

I think overall balancing is fine, you just have to be dedicated. The fact that it’s possible and many people consistently get to the very end irrespective of the build their running. Shows that clearly there is some level of skill that can lower the cringe game ending RNG in roguelikes. The only real complaint about balancing and you’ll know what I mean when you play, is that spikes were clearly not balanced around enemies getting them. Spikes are the cringiest thing ever, it doesn’t matter if you’re using multi-hitters or big-swingas. It will be a humbling experience, and you are going to learn TODAY.","0.52173912525177002","1681590152","true","1197","1725","0","17","279","1","0","0"

On top of that, the harsh and punishing nature of the game has made each success feel that much sweeter.

While I can see how the difficulty of the game can feel like a lot sometimes, especially when you find yourself in a guaranteed losing position for making a small mistake two turns ago, but I don't find the difficulty has made the game unplayable, and I find that the positives of this game (which are pretty much everything else) definitely outweigh the cons.

It forces you to think in new ways, which if you have 1,000+ hours in StS, will certainly be a struggle. You are going to lose a lot when you first start out, but that is part of the game's progression. As you progress through runs and complete quests, you unlock more upgrades, cards, tribes, and equipment which can make the next run easier, and that progression goes on until you reach a comfortable spot. In-fact, I wouldn't even call this game a deckbuilder. It's more of a strategy/tactics game than anything else. There are synergies between 'cards', but the way combat plays out is almost something like Fire Emblem or Advance Wars. 

Definitely check the game out as it has a fun art-style and interesting combat mechanics that make it stand-out amongst the plethora of roguelikes out there. Just don't go in expecting to win your first, or even your 20th run, because you will not.","0.523809552192687988","1681481594","true","88","3618","0","22","426","2","0","0"

I have heard a lot of complaints about the balance of the game, which I could understand, given that certain builds just seem to steam roll compared to others. I would argue this is the case for almost all deck-builders however. Balancing all of the mechanics perfectly in a game as mechanically rich as Wildfrost seems pretty far from possible in my opinion. I have almost always been able to point to myself, rather than the game, any time I lost a run. This comes with a few handful of exceptions. One exception being me intentionally experimenting with the mechanics of the game for the sake of science (Occasionally for the sake of answering a question about the mechanics that I think the game should've been more clear about. Mostly just trying to determine the order of operations for interactions between things like pepper+fury or applying ink vs 'on hit' effects.) Overall, it was a great experience though. I personally love to experiment with the mechanics of any game, especially deck builders, and Wildfrost often gave me very rewarding experiences as a result.

My main issue with the game is the amount of content, which I believe they have already mentioned is their main focus. 27 hours in an I have unlocked all but two achievements (one of which I believe to be a 'Do Everything Achievement', but i cant confirm that because I dont want to spoil myself). However, given the $20 price tag, I'd say that is well worth it. I always say that if I get an hour of entertainment per dollar spent, that a game was well worth the price. Not to mention, I consider myself pretty skilled at deck builders, so I flew through the game compared to any more casual players out there. So for me personally, I think the game is well worth it in its current state. I JUST WANT MORE!

Overall I'd say 8/10, looking forward to playing more!","0.523809552192687988","1681862609","true","1639","1815","0","1","190","1","0","0"

I would place this game on the same level as those games easily, and especially if they address some of the issues I mention below. After 60+ hours of playing, I would even go as far to say that it's my favorite roguelike of all them all.

The game overall is extremely polished. The combat is unique to the genre with dynamic positioning options, card selections and manipulation, and tons of emergent gameplay with the mechanics interactions. Lots of decision-making and thought involved in your play patterns. Really creative ways to pilot your units and give them synergy.

The art is great, and the design for the game board is brilliant. For a game where not reading all the text in the field can end your run, they do a great job with visual feedback, clarity, and indicators. Not everything was explained to the level I would have liked, but the combat log usually explains what went down.

I will echo what other reviewers mentioned though, which is that the runthroughs can feel really feast or famine. There are some issues:
- For new players, enemies that force 'Aimless' onto your allies or have Aimless themselves feel very unfair, forcing your units to attack into thorns or other detrimental effects or to possibly get sniped by enemies
- Starting heroes can be very very bad, sometimes offering you triple aimless/barrage keywords which can be deadly run-enders. You can 'reroll' your heroes by starting a run, then abandoning, so why isn't there a reroll button?
- Limited path branching means not as much agency with map nodes--would like to see that expanded to have more choices.

I really hope they plan on making balance changes. The game is easily worth $20 regardless, though!","0","1681375820","true","689","11769","0","1","0","0","0","0"

I saw all the people critizising that it is too hard. And though I do get the sentiment, it doesn't impact my enjoyment of the game at all. 
It is the first time that I play a game like this. I haven't played Slay the Spire or similar titles yet. So I am going in with less experience or the ability to compare, but each run I learn something new and everytime I loose, I just go again and see what I can put together this time. I don't even need to reach the last boss to feel good about it, when I can easily clear one battle, I already feel accomplished. The art is amazing and the synergies can get really fun, if you hit the right cards.

So I hope that more people will give it a chance and see for themselves. I don't think I would enjoy it as much or be that obsessed if it would be easier.","0","1681858096","true","790","2038","0","2","0","0","0","0"

Though, it's not a game you can play super casually - if you've only got a little bit of time for it, you're probably not gonna progress very far and the game will feel unfair because of that. If you've got the time for it, it's an excellent game; just not as casual as it might appear from the roguelite gameplay.

The game itself is pretty difficult. It took me about 15 attempts before my first win, but as you learn the game, it starts getting easier and easier. Once you die a few times because you weren't paying attention to an ox with smackback, you'll start paying more attention to that. The learning curve is pretty unforgiving, but in my opinion, that makes it fun. 

The balance of the game seems pretty good. At first I was worried because my decks weren't synergizing well, but once I started using charms, moving my units around the board, sending my compainions back into the deck, etc. It started to feel better. Basically, you need to be using every tool you have availible or else you'll fall behind. 

Honestly, my biggest criticism is the starting characters. They either feel way too good or they feel like you only chose them because the other 2 options were basically unplayable. Having a starting character that has an attack counter of over 5 is really difficult for many combats. Sometimes, you don't have enough tempo early on, and fall too far behind. These first few turns feel reliant on your starting character unless you have a deck or companions catered towards protecting until that turn.

I've been addicted to this game and will probably be playing it for quite a while as long as it gets continued updates. I'm excited for the way this is going to go. Since it's a newer game, of course there are going to be some balance issues, but that'll come in time.","0","1681855564","true","577","681","0","21","316","0","0","0"

I play all the ones I can find. This one is one of the worst and hardest I've come across. I want to like it, but the game weighs it against you to the point where it loses the fun quickly.

For example, you have allies that can help you fight. However, if an ally dies in a fight, the enter the next fight at half health and half attack. The only way to get the ally to no be injured is to have them survive a fight, which at lowered stats, is almost impossible. When the difficulty ramps up with every battle, having an ally at half health/damage means you almost guarantee a lose on the fight. 

Boss fights are insanely difficult with most bosses having multiple forms. Sure, you unlock more bonuses as you play that make it marginally easier, but constantly losing with really nothing to show for it really takes the fun out of the game. I did a good 10 runs and beat the first boss twice and immediately lost the next fight. 

The sheer level of difficulty and frustration makes it a pass for me. Maybe if you see it on sale, but I can't recommend it. If not for the crappy injury mechanic, I might enjoy it more, but it's not great as it is.","0.453028678894042969","1681855013","false","164","169","0","11","0","0","0","0"

It is only hard for some time then it gets easier really fast when you have your 'aha!' moment with the game, knowing what to do and which things to prioritize. I get where the complaints are coming from, games like these usually have a wide difficulty range (Covenants up to 25 in Monster Train, Ascensions up to whatever it is in Spire, Heat up to 50 in Hades and so on) usually those games have a low starting difficulty that ramps up to being proficient enough in the game to know the possibilities in and out, however, WIldfrost has a smaller range than others like it, it starts out pretty challenging and doesn't get much harder than that, so i truly get where the negative reviews are coming from since everyone must think 'if it starts out like this, i can't imagine what the end game stuff would look like'. well that was my insights on the difficulty reviews of the game. Now to the RNG stuff, yes this game has RNG mainly with aimless, but that could be easily mitigated or worked around, once u start to learn the game, you WILL be able to work around all of the RNG stuff, Haze, Aimless, even bigfoots.

Pros:
- Visuals are 10/10
- Soundtracks are amazing
- snoof
- gameplay is fluid, really fun and brain teasing
- IT IS WELL BALANCED (for the most part)

Cons:
- Hard entry level
- Expects you to learn strategies on your own (most of the genre does this anyways)
- Progression doesn't happen retroactively (u need to complete quest A first to start progress on quest B which sucks since most later quests are pretty challenging)
- bigfoot
- deckbuilding skills aren't needed as much as tactical or puzzle solving skills
- needs a content update
- boss rewards are dependent on which boss u fight (big peng gives way more blings than snow knight which sucks, but its not a major upset dw)

9/10, TLDR, needs more content, has a high entry level but doesn't get much harder than that, don't worry about other reviewers scaring you to try, everyone is entitled to their opinion and everything is valid, if this looks like something u might enjoy, give it a spin!","0","1681853217","true","899","1330","0","1","13","0","0","1"

This game is really good! It is a very fun deck building adventure. The art style is super cute easily the first part that caught my attention. The gameplay is very fun and easy to understand but has a surprising amount of depth. Discovering interactions has been a blast and effectively using your arsenal feels so good! That and with the challenge when you do win it does feel amazing. Rarely did a fight feel like it was a cake walk.
This game makes me super excited for its future prospects and possibilities!

In the middle, I find the relatively short runs to be a blessing and a curse. They're fun but things feel like they ramp up FAST. 

Now on the other side, the interactions can be as frustrating as they are enjoyable. I've accidentally infinite'd myself to death so many times. That and some encounters feel like they are just 'you lose' if you come in with a certain combination or build. 
The game could very much use a glossary for all the affects in it rather than needing to look at the specific cards with it and some cards and trinkets could use better clarification on how they affect other things.","0","1681852411","true","602","1318","0","3","0","0","0","0"

The fact that the best week one players (and even plenty of mid players such as myself) can win reasonably consistently is enough to verify that the issues of balance mentioned in many of the negative reviews are at least a little overblown. A direct difficulty comparison to STS doesn't quite work here since different skillsets are emphasized, but having played both I'll make the attempt. Simply winning a run, with initial unmodified settings, is probably about as difficult as a10-a15 (non-heart). So the skill floor is somewhat higher, but I don't see this as a bad thing; I can already tell that the skill *ceiling* is ridiculously high which is great. 

So, yeah. Combat is fascinating and hella satisfying with a challenge level that feels like the epitome of difficult but fair. Aesthetics are *adorable,* which is a huge plus for me. The noomlins, the heroes and companions, the enemies, the town... everything is so freakin cute and I love it.

The game's not perfect on release, of course. There are a few bugs with the mechanics, and there's a few enemies who will likely get slight rebalances (looking at you, Bigfoot... 7 damage and aimless, nani?!) But even in the current state, the game is in excellent shape and set to be a cult classic. I can only hope that enough new people try and review this game to offset the initial 50% positivereview tank (already up to 70% as of this writing), because I firmly believe that this is worth a play for any enjoyer of roguelike deckbuilding games that doesn't mind a hella cute but hella fierce challenge.","0","1681849513","true","746","2550","0","19","386","0","0","0"

Still lots to figure out so I'd place it just below Slay the Spire. There is likely more randomness than Slay the Spire. The difficulty in this game is the lethality. So many interactions will just end your run on the spot if you are not careful. The upside is that the animations and runs are shorter than others in the genre so it does not feel as punishing when you lose. The suddenness is jarring.

Feels more interesting that Monster Train since the different statuses force you to adapt your tactics more. Less of a slog than Pirates Outlaws (which has runs that are too long in my opinion). The meta progression is good and an improvement in the genre. Having to complete specific tasks for certain cards is the way to go. The trinkets feel a little too random, but they are so tempting. I hated Across the Obelisk (very long runs, trite progression). Fights are far more unique than Dawncaster.

My biggest gripe is the limited options in choosing a leader to start the run.

The game is crazy fucking hard man. Alot of the time I find my runs ending because I get unlucky and run into the fight that exactly counters my team.

Also must have some kind of fucking brain damage because I seem to be the only one of my friends that cannot fucking figure the strategy of this game out. Everyone else is raking in achievements and win streaks and I still can't seem to make a decent combo that beats a single of the AI decks.

Some of the randomly generated characters you play as are just objectively better than the others, so sometimes I find myself just killing off characters until I find one I think actually stands a chance. It doesn't help.

I feel like I'm getting better at the game mechanically- but my 18 hour loss streak tells me otherwise. Most of the time I don't even particularly enjoy playing the game, but I sampled the fruit and now I simply cannot stop. I monotonously click play again over and over and over- just hoping that the next one will be THE one, but after playing for 18 hours it still hasn't happened.

While I personally tend to enjoy games which skew on the more challenging side of things, I can certainly see why some folks would be turned off by the difficulty. I would love to see the developers add some accessibility options to allow a more toned down difficulty so that more players can enjoy this awesome game.

The whiny babies that seemingly bombarded this game with negative reviews when this game came out are absolutely ridiculous. Complaining about difficulty in a game that is tagged 'Difficult' is actually kind of hilarious.

First, it's a roguelike, so you're designed to lose at some point and restart, that's just how the genre works.
Second, the difficulty is actually very well designed. It's hard, but fair, and there's always been a way to beat a level from what I've seen. It's just that there are ways to misplay and the game punishes you for doing so, which is amazing!

Other than that, I love the design, the gameplay is fun and varied. Building your deck actually requires some thought, which a lot of deckbuilders I find fail at this to some degree and you can just faceroll things.","0.462046205997467041","1681837338","true","60","723","0","5","0","1","0","0"

I think that the BIGGEST thing this game needs is a mechanics that shows what will happen in the next term a la Monster Train because so many of the mechanics are new and attacking orders are confusing at times.

EDIT: Having beaten the final boss once, I still think that the success is too reliant on:

1. Getting good synergy without providing enough opportunities to get said synergy. Maybe there should be some slight adjustment to getting drops that correlate with what you have (if you start with a weakness leader, it should drop weakness minions and spells more). 
2. Getting crowns at the shop, which stifles what you can get at shops a bit.
3. Getting a good leader. Bad leader choices = a lost run and you might as well kill off your leader and go to the next run immediately.

The only balance issue I really see is that you seem to need to commit to a strategy/mechanic from very early on, and if you don't get the appropriate components through RNG you may be dead in the water. Again, I haven't spent enough time with it to tell if this is really the case.

What opened up in the game afterwards blew me away and got me so hyped up for my next run. This game just feels amazing to play and is so satisfying because everything is calculated and planned, meaning overcoming a difficult encounter feels that much more thrilling. It also means losing is always a learning experience. I've barely scratched the surface, but what I've seen so far already has been better than every other deckbuilder I've played since StS. The art style and fantastic soundtrack cement this as an instant favorite for me. 

Please don't listen to the negative reviews. If they're complaining about being put up against hard rng or impossible encounters, I'm likely guessing they're expecting to beat the game with a deck with little effect, charm, or item synergy in addition to playing poorly during combat. The grid-based and turn-counter based combat systems add many levels to the complexity and require thinking multiple turns ahead to grasp the concepts that are necessary to succeed in this game.","0","1681836362","true","151","620","0","8","432","3","0","0"

The music is nice and doesn't irritate your ears even after multiple hours of playing the game with headphones.

The artwork is exactly what I want in a roguelike produced by an indie company. It has just the right amount of details and is pretty to look at.

The gameplay is very fun and adds a lot of fun strategic elements. It definitely is NOT too hard if you're willing to think and are looking for a challenge. I decided to pick this game up for myself after watching somebody else play this game on youtube (on their first try) and fail. By just knowing the core mechanics of the game and being interested in strategizing + puzzle solving I managed to beat the game on both my 1st and 2nd attempt.

I want to note 3 aspects that make this game outstanding compared to other deckbuilding roguelikes:

1. The pacing. Every fight has a 'major' enemy/boss in it. This ensures that no fight feels boring or like an unnecessary grind. At the same time each choice you can make regarding your deck feels important and impacts it a lot. 

2. The difficulty. While others may be put off by the game providing a challenge I actually enjoyed the feeling of being threatened in most levels and trying to figure out a solution.

3. The final boss. I'm assuming the final boss for the first playthroughs isn't actually the 'final' boss however I want to highlight this genius idea. The fact that your previous characters become the new boss after a successful playthrough gives you an unlimited amount of replayability and is very creative. 

All in all a fantastic game if you enjoy deckbuilding roguelikes such as Slay the Spire.","0","1681835152","true","211","1844","0","4","73","0","0","0"

That said, within these 3 runs: I've reached the final combat(s?) of what I assume is the non-true ending [making this assumption because I haven't seen the ending yet], I've gotten 8 or so unlocks/challenges completed, and I've explored several cool archetypes. And no, I did not lose because the combats were too hard; both my 2nd and 3rd runs ended because I misplayed and accidentally got my hero killed (one of which was on what I believe was the final combat of the non-true end).

So in conclusion. This game is cute. This game is fun. This game has vast replay-ability. This game has many unlocks and challenges. This game is not unbalanced. This is a 9/10 for me as a card-based roguelite (for comparison I would probably rate slay the spire as 10/10).

Art style is very cute and the lore is interesting even if it isn't too deep at the point that I'm at in my playtime.

Unlike many other roguelike deckbuilders this game actually feels slightly ..dare I say it.. EASIER. You get multiple turns to plan ahead with the real difficulty coming from stringing together combo kills. The more combos you pull off the more coins you get which is very rewarding if done correctly early on. 

For me, Wildfrost is much more enjoyable than the archetype's predecessors that I've played, notably STS. If the only thing pushing you away from the game are 'It's too hard!!1!1' reviews, I'd say it's a pretty safe purchase.","0","1681833565","true","489","819","0","2","0","1","0","0"

I haven't been disappointed so far, even not having quite beaten the game yet, I've gotten close, but died to my own negligence on keeping track of triggers.

I'd say of the deckbuilding games I've played, this one feels most like Magic the Gathering to me in both a good and bad way.  There's so many things going on, and all of it is predictable, and in front of you, however it's easy to lose track of one or another triggers, creatures, even just get too invested in one plan and forget to check turn timers on enemy creatures.

I see and recognize complaints that this game needs some rebalancing -- I think it wouldn't hurt to touch up a few fights (I can look at the fight based around Teeth and Aimless as an example of one that feels overtuned in some aspects). And I think certain player deck types are much easier and more effective then others. However the game *is* beatable, and I think with experience it can be consistently beatable, as I've only had a few times where the enemy simply hard-counters the choice of deck that I have outright, which is a staple of these kinds of games anyway, the nature of RNG and varying fights.

Overall, I think this is worth the time and money, I sunk 10 hours into it over the course of 2 days, who knows how much more I will play it but in terms of enjoyment it was definitely worth the cost.","0","1681831840","true","614","1025","0","7","460","0","0","0"

This game is definitely not for the faint of heart, if you really take the time to learn everything it has to offer, you're in for a treat and it really makes you feel like a god gamer whenever you manage to beat the final boss.

If I had to critique is that sometimes losses feel a little unfair, I just had a good example, my best run yet, got to the boss of the 3rd area (which seems like it might be the last boss im not sure, it was very foreboding though) I felt like the fight was going well but I lost because I didnt notice 1 of my 6 units (which happens to be the only unit you need to keep alive) was attacking into a smackback unit and it smacked back past the front line unit (which i always seem to forget thats how it works) and 1 shot my main unit

It just feels like a really bad way to loose a run, my 5 other units completely undamaged and running away because an accidental smackback... 

I think that its obvious that i got punished for a mistake, which is how it should be, but its not just this one instance, I feel like sometimes this game punishes you disproportionately, losing because I know im about to die and have been worn down I'm a-ok with, but when I think a fight is going well and then i suddenly loose out of nowhere, that feels really bad

Devs if you read this, I really like this game, 100% worth the money! 

If you could add some kind of indicator for attacks thats a bit more obvious than the counter that would be great (and responses like smackback), and then the other thing id like is a list of who died on each side on the previous round, sometimes i loose a unit and my tiny brain doesnt even remember who died!","0","1681830096","true","652","1343","0","3","0","0","0","0"

This is an exceptionally high-quality roguelite card game, and plays out like a cross between Scrolls (the old Mojang game) and Monster Train. Whilst I have a wishlist of things I'd like to see in the game - including more decision-making in the 'map'/out-of-combat sections and pre-game setup - the actual in-combat strategy layer is excellent, the music and art are phenomenal and the complete package is refined and engaging. 

If you liked Monster Train, you'll almost certainly enjoy Wildfrost. If you haven't played Monster Train, though, you should probably start with that.

One bit of gameplay advice, however...
Like Monster Train, it's a moderately difficult game that demands at least a degree of flexibility in deckbuilding to accommodate the very different mechanics of enemies and bosses, so be aware that going all-in on a single strategy or archetype may not pan out as well as you'd like.","0","1681826375","true","333","1706","0","46","0","0","0","0"

The game is pretty hard, but not THAT much harder than other roguelike deckbuilders. I've played a lot of Slay the Spire, and I'm not great at it, maybe my win rate is less than 10% overall in that game, yet it's always been universally praised (for good reason) while Wildfrost has been pretty harshly criticized in my opinion. I think people aren't used to the mechanics of the game, and the fact that you can move your units around freely, use them to block damage from other units, and even pull them back into your deck to heal them or prevent them from being targeted from barrage attacks and stuff, 

It's totally winnable in its current state. I got really far in my first few attempts even without any unlocks. When I lose, it often felt like it was mostly my fault. But these kinds of games are also pretty heavy on RNG and what you're given, and while every card seems like they could be useful, sometimes your choices won't mesh perfectly well with your current build.

It's a fun game, incredibly charming with great sound effects, music, and UI.

While I can see both sides of the argument, for me, where I see the problem is everyone calling it a deckbuilder first. I am not a veteran deckbuilder, I actually suck at them. What I am decent at is tactics games and that's what I would call this game first. 

Seeing people say A20 StS players are having issues and stuff means nothing to me because I feel like deckbuilding takes a backseat in this game and the tactics come first. You can pick any card you want that you feel should be right but if you aren't taking advantage of healing companions, working around the counter system, moving units around to avoid debuffs/damage, you aren't gonna get far at all. 

I thought this game was really tough at first but in reality, it's just so different from what's out there and you do get used to it the more you play. I secured a win on my first couple of attempts and it felt real good to do so. I'm actually really glad this doesn't have an Ascension system like the more traditional deckbuilders out and it's more of a 'what you see is what you get' kind of game and I can respect that. It's not gonna be for everyone but I certainly enjoy it. The gameplay is so tight and fluid, the art is just incredible and there's little details that really give the game character (like Yuki's snowball growing) and the soundtrack is for sure one of my favorites this year so far. There are some things that can be improved upon but going over the dev's first update post, sounds like it's in good hands.","0.889943063259124756","1681789455","true","624","1050","0","112","2028","219","1","0"

The game systems and gameplay feel good at its core, but the RNG elements slap you so hard 99% of the time it feels unfun for a lot of runs. It's made worse because unlocking new content, instead of feeling good, feels bad 75% of the time because most unlocks add more RNG and makes it that much harder to get synergy in your runs.

I think I cleared the final boss on my first or second run because I got a ton of synergy with Shell, but once I unlocked a few charms and gizmodos the RNG took a nosedive and I've had maybe 1-2 runs of solid synergy since (currently at 30+ hours of playtime). It's made worse as you unlock the 2 other factions, because whereas you got 3 choices for 1 deck, letting you pick the best of 3 options for the base deck, you now have 1 option for 3 different decks each, which means you're way more likely to get a bad hero or get forced into running a deck that doesn't fit the hero, etc. 

The weird thing is that, despite the wall of RNG you end up getting slapped with, the game feels lacking in content. The battles are limited in variety, and the lack of any change in the background/maps feels samey. 

In short - 

+ Gameplay is great in general
+ Visually pleasing

- RNG and progression feels bad 
- 'Hero' feels like deadweight most of the time
- Limited content for a 1.0 release","0.521358728408813477","1681810224","true","1956","2627","0","102","0","2","0","0"

In the first few hours it felt unbeatable though (and yes, I've died on the first fight -not boss- a few times), but the great mechanics and the good flow made me come back to it again and again, sometimes in disbelieve that I died again on the first boss. The fight after the first boss felt stupidly unbeatable at first as well. 
The game is not unbalanced, it's just very different mechanically from what one might think at first.

In Essence, the game has incredible mechanics that feel super fresh for a roguelike coming out in 2023. It's definitely not yet another StS and also quite different from Monster Train. Check it out, but give yourself a few hours to grasp it before giving up!

First of all, the graphics are top notch, everything is very well animated and presented. The music is an absolute banger as well. The game is also very well polished. In my ~7 hours of playtime so far I didn't encounter a single bug yet.

Don't let the cute aesthetics fool you, the game is pretty punishing, which leads to quick deaths when making small mistakes, but it also manages to get you in to the next run quickly. I feel like many people are used to StS, where you slowly build yourself into a corner and your health gets whittled down slowly until you finally die. This game kills you fast if you aren't careful, but it feels very rewarding to solve a fight that seemed doomed from the beginning.
I rarely had a moment where I felt like it wasn't my own fault or could at least see what let to my demise in the end. Sure, you sometimes just don't get the stuff you need, but that's pretty much every roguelike. At least in this one, it's over quickly if that happens.

Just give it a try if you like hard card battlers, it's definitely worth it, but don't expect a cute casual experience.","0","1681801927","true","405","1287","0","4","1465","0","0","0"

The game is really not easy. But still very good because the runs are quite short. So if you lose, you do not have to wait long to get back to the same point. It's quite a fun loop.

I haven't felt so challenged in a good way in a long time. 
The gameplay is really something new and does a good job of making every move count. Which it usually does, as a small mistake often leads to the end.

Skill issue

Here's a few tips If you're having trouble:
1) Snow'd enemies don't counter when you hit them
2) Pepper lasts the duration of a multihit (maybe) 
3) Crown's and charms can solo win or lose the run
4) Don't greed for the loot goblin, its a bait
5) Commit fully to an archetype, it gets stronger exponentially when everything leans into the synergy

I was freaked out by everyone saying it was too hard, but I'm so glad I decided to risk it because this is easily the most engaging, polished, and exciting deckbuilder I've ever played. It does so many great ideas and fixes so many little issues I've had with the genre that I honestly don't know if I can go back to something like Slay the Spire after this. I know that sounds a little dramatic, but I'm serious - this game is an instant classic for me and I really, really hope more people try it out.

The first thing you notice with this game is obviously the art style and direction, which is incredible. Screenshots don't even do it justice - everything is animated with a great bouncy feel and every aspect of the game flows perfectly together with immediately accessible UI and clean, informative card design. But the game is also mechanically deep and a lot more complex than you would imagine, given the cartoonish style. I think a lot of the negative reviews, honestly, are just coming from people who got a little bit of whiplash because they weren't expecting something that looks like a kid's game to be so demanding. But it would be a mistake to think of Wildfrost as just 'hard' - it's better to say that it expects a lot from you. You can't get by the way you might in other deckbuilders, where it's more about what cards you choose and less about how you actually play them. Here, it's almost more like a traditional turn-based strategy game, where positioning and long-term planning inside the match are most important.

There are too many aspects of the actual game design to go into, but here are two quick things I want to highlight: The first is that this game has, for me, exactly the right amount of content in terms of different cards, charms, and enemies. It strikes a balance between feeling varied enough to avoid becoming stale, but not *so* varied that you feel overwhelmed. I've been playing for about three hours now and I feel like I'm consistently seeing new things, but I'm also noticing that everything coheres around a few basic concepts and ideas in a way that makes me feel like I could really get into the systems without feeling like every new run is going to throw me a total curveball. A lot of roguelike deckbuilders have a 'kitchen sink' mentality where they just think more, more, more is automatically better, but Wildfrost feels like a perfect example of a game where there's a lot of depth to be found in a relatively small core of interlocking concepts that work well together. I hope more games follow this mindset and stop just going for as many unbalanced, ultimately uninteresting cards as possible.

Secondly, I *love* the way this game integrates aspects of an autobattler by having both allies and enemies attack every few turns, rather than every single turn. It really opens up the possibility space for each battle and cuts down on the grueling feel that other deckbuilders can have, where every encounter is just each side slowly whittling down the other side's health in a perfect back-and-forth exchange. I love being able to plan things out a few steps in advance and build up turns where everything lines up and the entire enemy field gets cleared - it doesn't make the game easier, necessarily, but it does make everything feel significantly more open and friendly. As others have pointed out, this game is definitely very hard! But the structure makes it so you never feel like you were just trapped from the beginning or immediately annihilated. Even when I do end up losing, I always feel like it's my fault, which is the gold standard for games like this.

So yeah, I *highly* recommend this game and encourage everyone who might be on the fence to give it a shot. If you approach it with the right mindset and really take the time to learn its systems, I think you'll have a great time. I'm really looking forward to putting dozens of hours into this one. I really hope it gets passed the bumpy reception and takes off from here!","0.475604504346847534","1681796966","true","141","464","0","120","738","2","0","0"

 *update* took me 16 hours to win my first run, opinion on the game has not changed, i still have fun despite my abysmal win rate, sometimes you just die due to enemy placement, certain encounters have no out and you just have to take the L, and that's just the way it goes sometimes, i originally considered that a con, but most roguelikes have this same sorta 'welp that was unlucky' moment. more factions and cards would be good too, the game is still new so its to be expected that it has room to grow, to those hesitant due to the mixed reception, i encourage you to try it if you don't mind losing and learning from your mistakes, a mere 2/3 hours won't be enough to fully grasp the game, this game can be unfair at times, but its also extremely fun and rewarding.","0","1681332315","true","456","2728","0","3","0","0","0","0"

For a roguelike deckbuilder, this game is surprisingly more skill based than deck based.

I think the board manipulation aspect is both a positive and negative of this game - the great thing is it takes genuine skill to win at this game so when you finally achieve it it feels so much sweeter. You can win with seemingly bad decks by cleverly positioning your units and planning your crowd control cards, and it is very satisfying to defeat a boss with several units at low health but no one dying. On the other hand, the bad thing is now that I've won a couple times, this sense of improving at the game is starting to diminish: even though I'm building a new deck every time, the way I need to maneuver my units on the board to complete stages feels perhaps a bit too similar.

Overall the game is still amazing and I think it is unfair to say the game is unbalanced. It is balanced around the fact that you can and are supposed to plan your moves several turns ahead of time, based on information you already have access to on the board. Are the enemies all lined up to trigger at the same turn? Maybe you should disrupt that by freezing one of the dudes even though you're technically safe for two more turns. Is your debuffer triggering on the same turn as your attacker but safely tucked in the corner causing it to act last? You should swap the two's positions so you can maximise damage output. If I don't have an answer to that big dude that's going to attack in 3 turns, I should probably mulligan now and waste a turn rather than keep my hand full of deal 2 damage cards, in the hopes I find something to tank that hit or maybe freeze that guy for a couple more turns. It's a lot to keep track of and a lot of the depth to the game only becomes apparent as you play the game and understand where you made mistakes, and that's where the charm comes from.","0","1681792949","true","975","1222","0","9","316","1","0","0"

There's minor gripes that I can get into about it, but they're outweighed by the elements that keep me engaged in the gameplay loop it presents. I'll just get into the broad strokes of gameplay here, and if it collectively sounds even a little up your alley I'd definitely suggest it!

[b]The Action Economy[/b]: Playing a card takes your turn, or you can pitch the rest of your hand to draw a new set of cards from your deck. You can draw a new hand 'early' by spending a turn at any time. Basically, this means that a truly dead hand can be painful, but not run-killing. You can re-arrange units freely.

You can see in the screenshots above the little yellow star at the bottom-center of the units on the board. That's the amount of 'turns' before they act. Juggling unit placement and finding the exact little adjustments you need to get the 'best' out of every little step of the way can feel incredibly rewarding, letting you pull wins out from situations that might otherwise feel impossible.

[b]Your Leader[/b]: You start the game with one unit who is designated as your leader. If they die, the run ends on the spot. The 'Leaders' you can choose from at the start are a bit randomized, though they keep a semblance of their tribe's identity within that randomness.

[b]Companions[/b]: These are units you can add to your deck along the way! If they die, the run doesnt end, but they get 'wounded' for the next fight. This weakens them in health and strength. You can throw 'em back in the deck as a free action, healing them up a little bit. Sometimes you need to weigh the companion losing its luster [b]next[/b] fight against having an easier way to the end of [b]this[/b] fight. Let's say somebody has to tank that big boss hit, and if it can't be the leader...

[b]Cards ('Treasures')[/b]: Companions can be benched and swapped among themselves... But items are stuck in the deck. Here's one of those gripes I mentioned earlier: If you reach an event that offers you a new card for the deck, there is no 'pass' option. You NEED to add one in, even if it would just be dead weight. Anyways- these treasures generally quite powerful, and totally bricking on an option is actually quite uncommon in practice. Sometimes you get the exact card you need for your build, and other times you spend a whole run waiting for it. Anybody who has played a roguelike knows the feeling, nothing new there.

[b]Charms[/b]: Easily my favorite feature of the game. Charms are little add-ons which alter the function of the card you attach them to. They can go onto companions, treasures, and some on either! You have a charm that makes whatever it's put on freeze the enemy? Yeah, that could go on a companion so they freeze every time they attack... But what about tossing it on a treasure- that way you can snipe an enemy with a freeze the exact turn you need it?

They give a ton of variance to runs. There's only a few that feel 'strictly better' than others, but again- not necessarily a terrible thing to see in a game.

I'll also note [b]Crowns[/b]: They're essentially charms that say 'When the fight starts, I get a free 'Turn 0' to play my leader and everything that's crowned'. This means you can crown a build-around companion to get your most important sidekick rolled out without wasting a draw and a turn!.. Or you can put it on a treasure that buffs your units, letting you have a beefy commander right at the start of each fight.

**Spoiler, This Mechanic Comes After Beating the Final Boss**
[Spoiler][b]YOU are the Final Boss[/b]: After you beat the last boss, its spirit 'possesses' your winning team. This means that when you go back through the game, you fight 'npc' versions of your leader and companions- reworked slightly to function better as NPC versions of your former self. They keep ALL the charms you had before. This means you can get a god-run that comes back to haunt you. You're able to check-in on what that fight will look like at any point of your run as to allow you to plan ahead. For some particularly nasty team comps, you really need to formulate a proper counter from square-one.

Frankly, I love this. Having my past self as a mirror that I need to surpass or retool my whole run around the prospect of fighting is [b]so cool[/b] and the developers executed it perfectly.[/Spoiler]

[b]Non-Gameplay Aspects[/b]: I'm a sucker for this game's adorable style. I love how the names of the characters make it so talking about the game has you sound like you're losing your mind ('Sun Rod on Blonky to pop Krunker?'). The soundtrack is nice, and so many NPCs and companions are the exact type of adorable I have a weak spot for.

[b]tl;dr It's a fresh take on card battlers with fun gimmicks that really effectively keep runs fresh. There's depth to the gameplay that I hadn't outlined above, but even if you just like card battlers and the general style of the game, I'd consider buying it![/b]

I almost didnt pick this one up after seeing 'Mixed' and dont get me wrong, I get it. If you dont like rogue-likes, if your looking for a super casual card-battler, if your not down with RNG heavy runs than this game may not be for you. 

However, if your looking for a fresh card-battler experience that rewards making smart choices, ACTUALLY taking nuanced and strategic picks and plays this game may be one to check out. 

On top of unique additions to the genre like being able to rename your cards and unique progression through leveling up a homebase to unlock new mechanics and cards - Chucklefish is trying something new with this one and deserves some praise for being original if anything.

I think what's admirable about the game in its current state is that it feels like you're often 'making the most of a box of scraps' trying to come up with passable strategies with often subpar tools.

That being said, I think the overall variance is too high and that rng plays a bit too much of a role in a few key aspects.

Also, it often feels like the difference between the best cards in the game is be staggering.

Instead of the high performing cards being like 1.5x to 2x better than some of the weaker cards, it feels like some Leaders, Cards, and Companions are like 10x better than their competition.

Overall I'm excited to see the team make tweaks the game, I hope they don't over correct because I think they close to something great here, but the game definitely needs some more love and care in the balancing department to make each run feel worth completing rather than just re-rolling for a better leader.","0","1681625706","true","159","3238","0","5","0","1","0","0"

Playing games is not gambling, true randomness does not bring enjoyment to players. Developers should use a certain degree of pseudo-randomness to enhance the player's experience. I don't know if the developers have played PVE in LOR, but Riot has already done a great job in this regard. In addition, as a rouge-like card game (DBG or something else but that's not the point) , the short game process and lack of opportunities to get and delete cards often lead to situations where it is difficult to build a successful deck. The low rewards also make the game's difficulty rise exponentially with each level, rather than having a reasonable difficulty curve that starts with difficulty and becomes easier. 
I really like the gameplay part of this game you designed, and I sincerely hope that the developers can improve their game to make it better.

The cards are easy to understand, yet the battles are challenging and can be tricky. Though you might have to take some time thinking each turn, it isn't exhausting because you don't have to constantly re-read long card descriptions. The uniqueness of the gameplay will make it hard to win runs at first, but it's definitely not impossible.

Everyone's talking about the difficulty, but the point I'd like to praise the most is the art/animation. This is part of why the mechanics are so easy to understand: they're presented in a simple and adorable format. You can put crowns and little charms on your cards, and there's even a card effect that adds a small animal to the top of your card. These details add flavor and greatly improve the overall experience. It's clear the devs put a lot of effort into making the game look good, so it's a shame that aspect isn't being appreciated more.","0","1681784003","true","252","1754","0","1","0","1","0","0"

It has a bit of a learning curve but it's not really that hard. There are a lot of moving parts and stuff to take into consideration, but in no time you understand what sinergies work and what combos to go for, allowing you to have super powerful runs.

My simple suggestion would be to allow drafting from any unlocked tribe, despite what champion you choose for the run. It could be weighted to favor the tribe you selected, but why limit the card pool so much? It's not like there's a plethora of cards to choose from in each tribe. 

In terms of balance, most of the game is incredibly difficult and some fights feel down-right impossible when most of the bosses have pretty tough mechanics, enemies that continuously fill the board with punishing passives, damage, and health, and all while 75% of bosses can only take 1 snow at a time (this mechanic is overused and should not even be considered as a balancing tool...remove it from all but the snow-themed boss).

I would love to come back and give the game another try after a proper balance update and maybe some new card additions, but as of right now I can't recommend this game as much as I want to.

However some reviews here would have you think the first boss had hyper armor, multi hit , and 50 plus attack. 
I don't consider myself a gate keeping master of games but I'm afraid negative reviewers are running into an error known as a 'skill issue'. All of that aside, wonderful game play loop, wonderful art, would recommend to anyone who likes tactical card games.

Also a tip for anyone who's struggling, card synergy is key.  For example, if you recruit Big Berry, might be a good idea to also find his little bro.

The presentation and moment to moment tactical gameplay had me hooked for days in a row. The graphic and auditory design is peak; the sounds and animations are very responsive even at a fast rate of play, and the more I play the more I get stuck in that great 'slot machine'-like-trance that games like Vampire Survivors impact on the player.  I actually see more influences from other indie games like darkest dungeon than from StS or MonsterTrain. 

In response to the other reviews, I do not believe that the difficulty is out of tune or unbalanced. At the time of this review 16 hours in, I have successfully completed the main campaign 4 times (three times with the optional challenge bells), and at least once with each tribe. Despite being new to the game (and having never played StS or MT), the book states I have a win rate of 18%, and that includes runs where I was still learning the game or runs where I obviously blundered early. Please take your time turn by turn and never take any moment for granted. If you come into this game with an xcom or darkest dungeon mentality you will succeed quickly. While I do find the game challenging, I rarely ever find it unfair. Devs, if you're reading this, be gentle with any balance changes, the game is fun as-is, and is refreshing for veteran gamers.

Good:
[list]
[*]The combination of monsters, item cards, and lanes makes for some deep strategy.
[*]Art and music are very charming.
[*]Different factions all have fun things.
[*]You can make things even harder if you so choose by toggling on some monsters that start with modifiers for extra gold per kill
[*]Has a daily run
[/list]

Not-so-good (personal opinion):
[list]
[*]Buying crowns in the shop seems super important, often more so than anything else
[*]Sometimes a run feels out of your control if you randomly get a set of enemies for which you haven't gotten the random card choices you need (e.g. thorns enemies)
[*]It can be really easy to kill your main hero and instantly end the run since there's no final 'end turn' button and there's no indicator of if you're about to kill your hero with some crazy chain of events you didn't 4D-chess out in your head.  If you are about to place the last card so you have a full board, moving things around without ending your turn by placing your card can be rough.
[*]There doesn't seem to be calculated randomness in your first draw - you can NOT get a character card in your first hand and you need to waste some time rerolling for them (see: crowns being important)
[*]Unlocks can feel slow, especially at the beginning.  You can only progress towards unlocking one card in each category at a time (excepting charms/card mods) and sometimes you have to go a bit out of your way.

That just reminds me of how Mithrix in Risk of Rain 2 used to be where players started sandbagging their builds to not buff him too much, but hey they nerfed Mithrix's item theft into the ground and now he's a joke.

This game was always going to be polarising on release (from hindsight) as It combines the worst of both slay the spire and monster train for players new to the genre. 

1) Through lack of healing/mitigation cards and disruptive enemy design, Wildfrost heavily encourages faster and more aggressive lines of play to implement your win condition. Unlike sts, Wildfrost lacks the gradual ascension mechanic to help tutor new players into the proper deck building/operation philosophy. Despite this, its far easier to understand and learn how/why you died as opposed to sts, as the runs are much shorter allowing for faster development of your run analysis ability. 

2) With only 8 opportunities to alter your deck and gain strength, the game falls out with the same category of players that couldn't adapt to monster train and only liked sts. With limited opportunities to affect your run, the game feels far too reliant on RNG to reliably force a win as you are seemingly at the whim of the card picks. Similar to monster train, this feeling only lasts for as long as you aren't familiar with the available card pool and how to optimise a run quickly. .

With combination of interesting card design, unique card tribes and beautiful stylization, Wildfrost is probably not as good as sts but is certainly an incredible card game.

It's my understanding that a large Chinese content creator disliked the game (probably because they couldnt win if I had to guess) and as a result the game has been review bombed by fans. Look it up for yourselves, but something to bare in mind that the game has a very positive rating without that creators influence in play

I have no idea why this game has mixed reviews, honestly. In true roguelike fashion, the more you unlock the easier the game is. The more you learn about the strategies it offers, the more you will pop off and have a successful run. People complaining about the difficulty likely arent big fans of the genre, as the things they are complaining about are literally the genre defining features.
Beautiful art, interesting mechanics, lots to learn, tons to unlock, daily challenges, satisfying variety, this game checks so many boxes I need to enjoy a game. The game absolutely requires you to really think through your moves, and if you are losing too often for your liking I recommend focusing on unlocking things rather than winning a run, and that you slow down and really think about your moves.
This game WILL punish you for making bad choices, as it's designed to. There is absolutely a luck element to the game, as is the case with all deckbuilder roguelikes, but that's half the fun is either rolling with the punches and seeing what you can make or trying to force a specific build you want to try. You never know what you'll get and that variety keeps things fresh and fun.

The devs did an incredible job on the game and the mechanics, and the people whining about the difficulty simply arent interested in putting in the effort to learn the mechanics and their counters. If you don't want to that's fine, but the game doesnt deserve to be called 'unbalanced' just because you can't be bother to play unless it hands you a win. The roguelike genre is made to be difficult: this is like people going to a soulslike game and complaining that it's unbalanced because it's hard and punishes you for making bad choices.
The game is balanced around being difficult, and if you can't handle that it's totally fair to not buy it, but it had a demo out for ages before releasing and the players who played the demo and are now complaining about it being unbalanced have no idea what theyre talking about. I played the demo as well, and it really hasnt changed much since then.","0.5","1681360575","true","453","1532","0","37","0","5","1","0"

It is gorgeous, and the entire presentation is absolutely lovely, but the core game-play loop is just a mess.
I've watched streamers have absolutely remarkable runs; crushing the end boss, despite making sub-optimal choices, or outright mistakes (by their own call-outs) due to stumbling onto a combo that broke things wide open. 
I have had complete nonsense carry me past the 3rd boss because I randomly drew 2 charms that created a combo that erased the field.
I've also lost to the first boss because there was no opportunity to add answers I needed to my deck in order to pass their gate. 
Note: Not because I didn't know about the gate/check, 
Not because I didn't realize I needed an answer, 
Not because I didn't know there was an answer within the mechanics, 
but because I was never given the option to add Damage/HP/Delay elements, etc.
You know how in Monster Train, Slay the Spire, and most other games in this genre; you can sort of decide how your deck is going to develop based on which leader and cards you select (find) early on? That is in no way possible in WildFrost: Your entire run will be random from start to finish. 

I have lots of experience with Rogue-like deck builders. I'm no master class tactical genius, I don't tend to beat high level acensions, or devote enough time to memorizing the various enemies, gates, and tools to create a win con out out of nothing; but generally these games accomplish the feeling of learning something with each run. 
Either you encounter a new enemy you know now to account for, or you see a new interaction that you can incorporate going forward.
The more I play WildFrost, the less I feel like I'm making meaningful choices about my runs.
In the actual combat - I feel in control and can see and understand the interactions. 
but between the battles - it's just a random number generator spitting out results. 

Don't have enough damage? Good luck finding some.
Brought a poison leader and got a poison based unit in your first cube? It is entirely possible that those will be the only Poison units/cards you see for the rest of the run. 
Need more delay? Hope one of those treasure boxes has a Snow card, or a snow charm, or a shop rolls well
Don't have a 'tank' unit? Roll the Ice-Slot and see if the odds favor you. You can't buy units, charms are random, and there's few cards that can turn a medium unit into a damage shield. 
Shade or Gnome Leader with a low health pool? Best of luck avoiding all Teeth, Poison, Smackback, Barrage, or Aimless units as you'll see few options to heal your very squishy Loss Condition. 

I just don't see the point of playing more runs? I'm not unfamiliar or confused about any of the cards or options, I just don't feel like I have a real hand on the wheel. Pick a path and pray I guess. 
Lots of folks are ascribing these complaints as coimplaints about the difficulty. 
I disagree; I don't think this game is any harder than StS, Monster Train, or any of the other rogue-like deck-builders on the market.
It presents battles of similar challenge, with a variety of interesting cards and mechanics. 
The variable turn counter per unit is an interesting twist in complexity - but it's not 'more difficult'
The core problem is that despite a reasonably well built combat system,
the deck modification systems are completely broken, half useless, and backed around constant RNG surprises. 

It feels like they want you to experience that Gatcha game 'pack-open serotonin-hit' with every choice, but forgot that they made their bosses require very specific deck design choices to defeat.

A single misplay can end your run, but RNG is not as bad as some negative reviews suggest (winstreaks are very much possible). I think most of the RNG complaints stem forth from the fact that some commander+pet combos are simply nonviable. However from the set of three you can pick from, there's pretty much always one that is viable. When in doubt, pick Snoof! (he can allow you to survive early game with otherwise nonviable leaders)

The ascension mechanic is really interesting and it might make you regret creating an OP character with tons of charms :).

Wildfrost really caught my eye though when I saw a couple of streamers I like play it. The game is... okay. Its playable, there are fun moments, but the run to run plays don't have much variety to them. Gonna make a lot of comparisons to StS and Monster Train since those are the best examples I can think of.

Gameplay is definitely closer to Monster Train. Do a fight, pick a path which typically has 3 stops to improve your deck before the next fight. In Monster Train, you can interact with these in any order, and make the best decision based on all of the information available. In this, it's linear, with the shop always being last if one showed up, which could've greatly impacted your prior two decisions. 

Another big whiff is artifacts, or relics, of which you get... 2. And it's always the same thing, an extra draw or faster redraw (the 3rd choice is a trap). A Snecko eye in A1 is going to impact future selections, making a 3 cost card more attractive for example. Dazing enemies that enter the pyre room can save a ton of health and change priorities during a Monster Train fight. Wildfrost doesn't have that. It's just, +5 effect and consume charm with the +1 barrage health card makes my guys tankier.  It doesn't make anything more exciting and barely impacts future choices. 

The inventor tribe feels like junk (pun intended). Summons and easy frost access are an absolute must for creating units to absorb hits, or CCing enemies. If you don't get ink cards you lose, end of story, particularly the one that inks everything for 3 turns. Enemies become less of a threat when they're just a health and damage number. 


Balance is in a weird spot. There is a card that, at best, gives you a 1/6 chance of losing. The devs are really overvalue Longshot as I've never seen one below a 5 counter or above 3 attack, but a Smackback apply one frost hero has a counter of 4? 

Meta progression, while fun, is gated in a not fun way. I did a 6x combo, once, but because I wasn't that far along the progression I have to make the stars align again to unlock the pet. I've bought way more than 20 crowns, but nope, I wasn't there yet for it to count. 

The polish is there, for sure, and the last fight the first you do it is a really interesting approach to replayability.  The game just needs more to make each run feel more unique.","0","1681767986","true","1069","1556","0","11","44","1","0","0"

The difficulty is at a level where one mistake or missing one interaction can cost you the game, so just make sure you're ready to pay attention.

Some of the mechanics that makes this game stand out are

[list]
    [*]A beautifully modular system to upgrading your cards
    [*]A creative approach to combat that allows a variety of approaches to shine
    [*]Daily Challenges!
    [*]Cute 'town' with meta-progression that gives more options that can give you more options without making 
        the game dramatically easier
    [*]Fair but challenging difficulty
[/list]

The mixed reviews seem to be mostly focused on difficulty, so I will address it.
The game is definitely difficult, largely because of some cool mechanics that I haven't seen before. I don't expect many players are going to struggle to get a good run going, but quite a few will die to objective mistakes in the middle/endgame many times over. The combat is a bit like knocking over dominoes or a rube gold-burg machine, with the order of triggers and attacks mattering a lot. if you miscalculate or misunderstand how a turn will resolve, you could go from fine to immediately dead. It can be quite punishing, and because you don't have hp that carries between fights every fight has to be able to kill you to be interesting. I've been able to point out why I died in just about every run, I feel the game is very fair.

With that said, there are some moments that feel frustrating because the game lacks clarity in a few areas. I'm pretty experienced with deckbuilders, and In the first few hours of play I noticed there were quite a few issues where I would stop and ask 'which way will this mechanic resolve?'. And a lot of the time, it could work in two ways based on wording, and the only way to figure it out is to let the turn play out, often to your detriment. Additionally, some bosses have a second phase and some don't, with nothing to tell you if it does. This means you have to play every boss as if there will be another phase until you learn all the bosses, which forces you to play way to careful and slows down the game. after 7 hours I've tested enough things I'm running into less of this, but its definitely a game which makes you die unnecessary quite a few times to learn the mechanics.

If you want a deckbuilder which lets you sling cards quickly based mostly on vibes, look to another game. That can totally be a fun way to play a deckbuilder, but this one just doesn't allow for that playstyle, so I'd recommend passing on it.

If you're looking for a challenging deckbuilder with unique mechanics that will take a few runs for you to get your first wins, this game is one of the best I've tried.

Edit with comments after over 24 hours playtime:
This game has enormous potential but I'd agree that it is overtuned. Many times, you'll find that whether you win or lose comes down more to RNG than your build or strategy. There are clear balance issues that make some deck archetypes essentially unusable. Finally, while the idea of [spoiler] having to fight your victorious decks as the final boss [/spoiler] is a cool one, it effectively creates a system in which [spoiler] your best RNG becomes a new high water mark, only to be replaced if you luck out and get even better RNG before fighting the final boss [/spoiler]. I hope the devs continue to work on this as it has every chance of being a stand-out entry in this genre but it needs some work to allow players to feel more in control of their experience and express their deck creativity without effectively being punished for doing so.","0.533043563365936279","1681313809","true","56","2268","0","10","0","4","0","0"

RNG is a staple in most if not all Roguelites/Roguelikes. In this case It affects items, allies, charms, and environmental spaces. On first inspection, yes this game is filled with RNG, but what about the meat and potatoes of the game, the combat? Many would say yes, but that's just because that same many people haven't considered the big picture yet. Specific battles in certain stages of the game are entirely preset. This means that enemies, reinforcements, and enemy stats will be the same every time that battle is played. The only RNG gimmick about battles is which of the two preset battles are picked for the player to battle against, which doesn’t matter as the parts of the game where these selection of battles take place are around the same difficulty and are made for that part of the game. 

What about your deck? Yes, the starting hand order you get each battle is RNG based on the cards you have in your deck. Though most of the time your deck isn’t going to be 15+ cards big so merely hitting the bell to reroll your deck will give you a decent hand and from 20+ hours and 50+ runs of experience, losing your first turn  due to a reroll won’t kill a run, on its own, EVER. After your first hand, nothing about your deck is RNG based. All cards will be redrawn in the exact order they were discarded/played. 

Now what about enemies and allies themselves? There is never a point where you don’t know when an ally or enemy will attack or what effects that have when attacking. Now you may be thinking “What about the aimless effect?”. For those who don’t know, units with aimless attacks a random enemy in the same row. This makes it so that at max, that unit has a chance to hit up to three units. When the enemy has this, you can bait, freeze, debuff, kill, etc before they get to attack so honestly it's just a test of whether you can handle your deck well, since you should have at least two of these options to deal with it by default. so the RNG related to the enemy having that effect can be nullified. When your team has aimless, then it's a bit more difficult but overall good placement and implementing the strats from before should be more than enough to get by. 

Now let's address the RNG related to getting items and allies. Most of the time getting allies/items will be done via environmental treasures where the player is prompted with three choices of cards based on your faction or shops where you can purchase cards, charms, and crowns with bling (money) you get from battle. These cards can be anything in the faction but where I say that RNG doesn’t really matter, is that there isn’t that many cards in the game and a bunch of them fill similar roles and a ton of them synergize with allies or other cards, so the likelihood of not getting a build/strat to fight with, is the same odds a player just picking the cards that don’t work with that player’s build. Which seems to be an awful high amount considering the amount of downvotes due to “RNG problems”. 

Now after all of that lets finally talk about imbalance. I do agree that the game can be balanced better but I say that in regards to summons ONLY. Everything else in the game I don’t see as imbalanced at all. I merely see cards with niches and those that are versatile. One doesn’t make the other worse or better and they both have the same power. It's just the use case that is different. What's most likely happening with you players who think this game is startlingly imbalanced is that you are trying to make a strat work where you NEED exact charms, items, starting hand, and in-combat setups. Having two or more of these things makes that start hard to pull off if not just bad and/or impossible. This is not to say that the build itself is bad, but just to establish that you can’t make a build with all these things in mind. Builds in this game are more free form, where it is the center of the strategy the player is going for, but not ALL of what the player is going for. Mindlessly going for all in for a strat is a bad idea. The game rewards players for going for a build, yes, but it also rewards players for being versatile while also having a build. It's not one or the other, it's both, working in tandem to create a powerful deck. 

I apologize for the length of this but I have one more thing to add. A solution for the devs for my perceived opinion that summons are way too powerful. Make a mechanic called “ricochet” where any damage over the target’s health, that an attack deals, will go to the next target in the same row. Don’t make it a key mechanic in battle but something like barrage where it's used everywhere but only in small amounts. Don’t make it have its own dedicated battle like with teeth. If you read all of this, thank you for your time and have a nice one.

The learning curve is steep but once you figure out the movement, healing management and attacking pattern / turns; the game is manageably difficult and fun to play with loads of different possible builds and without spoilers; enemies. 
I have currently beaten the game twice (currently in a win streak) but keep in mind that took less than a day (maybe 6-8hrs in to do). Also the start is kinda slow but they ease you into the game and before ya know it you will be at the final battle.

I’m not one of the idiots you see in the reviews who hasn’t been able to beat the game once in 10+ hours, I’ve actually beaten the real final boss so you can’t just comment “git gud” and think you’ve owned me. I CAN’T be owned.

The art style of this game isn’t half bad, I can definitely see myself yanking it to a few of the female characters. The elf girl in the hot spring is a definite highlight, and before every run I check in there just to say hi to her. The cat girl in the companion hut is a bit of an odd case. She’s definitely got me feeling something strange and I don’t know if I like it. Personally I wouldn’t mind if there was a patch that made her a little less cat and a little more girl.

Wildfrost looks like it’s a deckbuilder that took a lot of inspiration from Monster Train, which was a very good game. However, in its current state the deckbuilding elements don’t really shine through that much. Maybe that’s intentional, maybe it’s not. The problem is that you don’t get many opportunities to add cards to your deck, so even against the final boss you’ll probably still be relying on some of the cards you’ve had with you since the start of the run. This means that most runs with a particular faction play out very similarly. Monster Train had a very good mechanic where your starting deck got partially randomized every run, which helped ease the issue these kinds of game tend to have with repetitive starts. Another problem is that when you have the opportunity to add a card to your deck, you can’t skip it. So, if you get three/four bad options, well, too bad! The end result is that treasure nodes are by far the worst you can encounter, and the best strategy is probably just to actively avoid hitting them so you aren’t forced to add bad cards to your deck. Why not give the option to skip them for a small amount of gold?

Leader generation is also a bit suspect. You get three presented to you before each run, one from each faction. If they die, you lose. The leaders all seem to be randomly generated to some extent, and more often than not most of them look awful and you don’t feel excited about picking any of them. I would honestly just rather have preset heroes, maybe three per faction. I don’t want to see another hero without any keywords, or just barrage or other non-faction keyword. Some kind of mix and match deal could also maybe work. Like, you pick from one of three basic heroes, then pick one of two or three bonus effects/charms to add to them.

Charms end up being the main way that you assemble a win condition because they allow you to add extra properties to cards without adding junk to your deck. The problem is that the node that gives charms gives you a random charm, and charm effects range from game-breaking to completely useless except in very specific situations. Sometimes you’ll get the charm that allows you to play a card without ending your turn – yay! – and sometimes you’ll get the charm that makes a card do two less damage – boo! Apparently there’s also some sort of vendor that sells charms, but I haven’t unlocked that yet. Considering how important charms are, I think that should be unlocked from the start, or the charm gacha should at least give you a choice from, like, two charms. A lot of the time it just feels like you’re holding out until you finally manage to get a usable charm, and then you’re finally allowed to play the game.

When you’re actually playing the game I think it works fine, but I think it would feel a lot better if the deckbuilding aspects were leaned into more. Usually your run’s going to go like this: pray for a usable leader, pray for at least two Buddies that have some sort of synergy, pick up defensive cards, attempt to survive until the game gives you one to two good scaling cards and one good charm, then abuse your one synergistic interaction to win the game. It ultimately doesn’t really feel like you’re playing with a deck of cards, more that you’re playing the one or two good cards you have and then hitting the redraw button so you can play them again. I know you’re also moving your deployed units around and recalling them and all that shit, but that part of the game basically plays itself. The deckbuilding elements are generally what give these games their depth, and in Wildfrost’s case I think those elements are just lacking. At the end of the day, at least elf girl is there for me.

It's not about being challenging, it's about being impossible as you have no control over anything. You cannot skip cards, you are somewhat randomized as to what hero card you start with and you have no idea what types of enemies you're going to be fighting. You may have built a highly synergistic deck and face off against a boss that completely counters that play style, at which point you have no chance to win, no matter how powerful you are. 

There are plenty of other deckbuilders that have bosses that can counter your playstyle, but you know that boss is coming well ahead of time so you can plan to build another way. Even if you do build to counter yourself, there's always a possibility you can win (Ex. Slay the Spire: 0 cost deck vs Time boss) but this game does not give you that opportunity to fight back and use strategy to make up for weaknesses in your deck.

Edit: Tried to come back and try it again. My leader unit got killed by aimless enemies attacking him 6 times in a row, despite having three other units on the board.

Game is great and overall well balanced

This game is genuinely one of the best roguelike deckbuilders I've ever played. It's so sad to see all of the negative reviews complaining about difficulty bringing the rating down. As of writing this review, I have 7.2 hours in the game and have already beaten the secret final boss [spoiler] The Heart of the Storm [/spoiler] with the three bell modifiers equipped on a three win streak. 

I'd like to talk about some of the game mechanics and how they compare to Slay the Spire. For context, I'm a huge fan of slay the spire and have over 1000 hours split between pc and mobile on the game as well as A20 heart kills with every character.

Consistency:
Many of the negative reviews complain about consistency, but this game is far more consistent than StS in almost every way. 

-Deck sizes are generally much smaller than the average StS deck, and are functionally even smaller due to the crowns. 

-Crowns are guaranteed at every shop which [spoiler] Automatically plays a card of your choice from your deck at the start of battle [/spoiler]. Can you imagine if StS just let you start the game with demon form or creative AI played already? 

-There are many generally good cards and every defensive option is viable outside of their mechanic specific decks. Frost, chump blockers, healing, and shields can all work just as well together as they can separately. This gives you so much more freedom to try and structure your offense rather than having to repeatedly forgo cool cards just to stay alive which was very common in high ascension StS.

-Charms let you build around almost any card you want. Imagine if you could make cleave apply vulnerable, stun, and draw a card in StS.

Agency and Flexibility:
For consistency, I could see how some people might have complaints if they haven't explored this game enough yet, but any complaints about lack of agency and decision making are just insane. 

-There are far fewer checkmate situations where you have no options in this game compared to StS. There are so many ways to distribute enemy damage in this game compared to just shielding it in StS. You can set up blockers early on or frost enemies to delay their attacks while you prep defenses. In StS, if you draw all your defensive cards before the enemy attack turn, you have no options. Almost every defensive card in this game can be played in advance or as a reaction.

-Free movement on every turn for every character is just an insane amount of flexibility. You can distribute damage among your team exactly how you want to with little to no prior planning required. 

-The one area where StS has more choice are the potions which don't have a correlate in this game. If the devs want to make the game a bit easier I'd imagine one time use consumables would be a fun get out of jail option that doesn't dumb the whole game down, but the difficulty is honestly great as is. 

Reasons for Skill Issue:
-There are more decisions that the player has to make every turn than there are in a game like StS.

-Counting is hard. Keeping track of attack timers can be overwhelming at first. If you need some counting help: [spoiler] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIniljT5lJI&ab_channel=SesameStreet [/spoiler]. In all seriousness though, it is a difficult mechanic to grasp when there are so many ways to manipulate attack timers. 

-You have to make your cards. Charms are a core aspect of the game and you have to make your deck op by strategically saving and using charms rather than just waiting for the perfect card to show up.

-Steep learning curve. Game is legitimately difficult, but it gives you more than enough options to succeed. Knowing how to use those options can take longer than some people's patience lasts though.

Cons:
This game isn't perfect though.

-The randomized heroes could use some fixing. I had one hero option who had the same keywords and attack as another, but had 4 extra max health and a different class. I can't imagine losing 4 max health being worth it to go from spectral to snow class especially since I think spectral class is a bit better in general.

-Companion space upgrade option from boss fights seem like the worst one every time. I feel like with all of the summon and clunker options, board space is generally too limited to make use of more companion space whereas more card draw and lower reroll cooldown are both extremely powerful.

-More tutorial info could be helpful. Some mechanics could be better explained such as how when a companion dies, they'll comeback for the next fight with an injured status. A longer, optional tutorial explaining more of the games mechanics could be good. I lost one of my first fights against the normal final boss, because I attacked 4 times into the spiked shield wall not realizing that the wooden health limited damage to 1. Total skill issue on my part, but optional tutorials/training modes would be cool to see. 

Something cool I would love to see added:
With all the various mechanics in the game, I think a puzzle mode would be amazing. It could serve as a low stakes way of learning the mechanics of the game without drowning in the salt we see in the reviews.","0","1681706901","true","431","1413","0","1","0","0","0","1"

The balance really is meticulous, maybe as good as Slay the Spire which is damn near perfect.

Yes, it's hard. You need the mindset that every single turn is important, every turn is a new little puzzle where you have to position your guys, trade hp for momentum etc. Over and over you are presented with situations that seem impossible, but somehow you figure it out with a bit of creativity. There is a lot of depth in these pretty simple mechanics, and uncovering new combinations is very rewarding.

If there is one thing to criticize, it's that it doesn't explain itself very well. A lot of vital stuff you have to figure out on your own, like exactly what order actions happen. Hopefully the devs respond to feedback by improving tutorials and tooltips, not by messing up the current balance. Maybe add an easier mode.

Wildfrost is a trickster god, appearing to us mortals in the garish form of a cutesy idle battler you might see available now on android and IOS. But step a hair closer, and you will find no hope here, no comfort or escapism. Wildfrost is a tribute to your legacy of disappointment. Every poor decision you have ever made in your life, every opportunity you squandered, every mistake that cost you permanent success in this finite world, Wildfrost was there. Watching. Committing your anguish to memory, that it might one day alchemize that anguish into the one compound you still hold dear in this world - video games.

To play Wildfrost is to suffer. If you do not re-evaluate the position and ordering of your minions every single round, you will fail. If you do not anticipate the actions of your enemies three rounds in advance, you will fail. If you redraw too late, or too early, you will fail. If you take the wrong path towards the final boss, you will fail. And if Wildfrost tires of your presence inside its domain at any point - you will fail.

To truly play this.......'game'.......you must understand the nature of doom, and the importance......nay, the NECESSITY......of standing before its maligned form and saying 'I will do this thing anyway.'. Doom will not be altered one iota for your neanderthal sentiment, but you will. Life is not about winning. Life is about doing what you can, with what you've got, until there's nothing left.

It's so sad that a fresh innovative take on the genre ends up having so many negative reviews. If you have any experience at Roguelike Deckbuilders you will enjoy the game just fine. If you are new to the genre and are eager to learn, you should do just fine as well, just be prepared to learn from defeats and optimize your strategy.

People whining that the game is difficult and unbalanced just don't know how to adapt to the challenge thrown at them. For reference, I won a run on my 2nd attempt at the game without any meta progress unlocks. 10 hours in i had 4 consecutive wins. While i understand some people are frustrated because they have a tough time making progress, this doesn't warrant a negative review, otherwise all Souls-like games would be downvoted to oblivion.

- Performance / Playability on Steam Deck is great

- Awesome Charm system which lets you augment cards
- The way you unlock new cards is interesting

CONS: 
- Only 3 factions - hopefully they release expansions for this
- Crowns seem too powerful - being able to purchase from shops seems like a no-brainer every shop
- Slow progress to unlock new cards (I am not sure how many unlockables there are - I am worried there are not a ton due to the slow progress, but that may be incorrect)

Good:
Artstyle is kind of cute.

Bad:
So, this is a card game where people say 'Ohhurhrnm~ This is like Slay the Spire and Monster Train!' First off, let me stop you there because those games were good and this one is not. Why is it not good? Well, a multitude of reasons, but the primary ones are the following -

1. There is a shocking difficulty curve. Now, I have cleared two runs in this game, but I can say without a doubt that a majority of the game feels tiresome in it's mechanics and play styles. Slay the spire and Monster Train had a variety of different strategies to clear waves/floors. Wildfrost? Not so much. You will build the exact same deck or fail 99% of the time.

2. It's final boss gimmick. Basically, when you clear a run, part of the deck you are using becomes the new final boss. Now, this may sound fun, but it's actually frustrating when you had perfect luck/rolls on your trinkets and card draws to only have an end boss that now feels like an absurd effort to get past. 

3. The unlocks for runs are also frustrating and tied to achievements and 99% of these unlocks are worthless. Oh boy! I bought five discount items at the store and now I have a pet dingo that will give my cards +1 health every seven turns! It's moments like this that make unlocking feel pointless and awful.

4. Random stat gen on starting leader cards. Enough said - There is a basic formula for generation, but often you will just pick up a hero, instead die, and restart the run due to the amount of garbage choices the game likes to produce. 

Basically, Wildfrost has a lack of options for play and while cute is a frustrating and painful experience. Chucklefish once again makes a terrible game and hopes their artstyle can salvage it. It won't work.","0.389485687017440796","1681745768","false","244","244","0","213","978","7","0","0"

That said. I am pretty experienced with deckbuilding rogue-likes (100 hrs of StS).  This game's difficulty is high but challenging.  I can see how a more casual audience who is drawn to Wildfrost's cutesy graphics would be frustrated by the baseline difficulty.

to be honest, I expected so much worse from the reviews. took me 5 hours to 'beat' the game for the first time and I'm usually not the greatest deck-builder player ever. 5-ish hours in these are my impressions:

-the battles are really fun and make you really think about what you are going to do next.

- I really really hate meta progression in roguelites but the way it was implemented in Wildfrost is the least annoying one I have encountered so far (except for not having one)

-the music is great. the graphics are great too although they might be a bit too cute for my taste, but great nonetheless.

-in contrast to what other reviews say I think that most, if not all of the builds can be viable and the random hero selection really made me experiment more with builds I would not have picked otherwise. much better in my opinion than picking the same OP build every time.

- the twist, where [spoiler] you play against the previous build you beat the game with is really nice and a good change from the usual roguelite template [/spoiler]

I can not say if it will keep me hooked for 100s of hours or even 20,  but at least from my time with the game I absolutely recommend you give it a go even if you are not the hardcore deck-builder type.","0","1681744718","true","261","1183","0","4","0","0","0","0"

I've played about 20 hours so far and I've had a great time with it. The art is fantastic, the music is great, and the gameplay is a lot of fun. 

I've seen a bunch of reviews complaining about the balance and ya there is something to that, the balance isn't perfect, but I've still had a lot of fun. I've also seen a lot of people comparing it to Slay the Spire, and I think that's also a bit unfair, Wildfrost is closer to something like Hearthstone than Slay the Spire, but better yet a mix of the two.

While comparing Wildfrost to StS a lot of people are complaining about the balance in Wildfrost, which again isn't quite fair as StS is just about the most perfectly balanced roguelike deckbuilder I've seen, it's a great goal but saying Wildfrost is bad because it doesn't meet that standard out of the gate isn't fair.

As for my own thoughts on it:
The runs are quite short, sort of, there aren't many fights between bosses but those fights can be quite involved so if you aren't overpowered it can take a lot of planning to win some of them with the cards you have. At the start of the game, you may be getting through the runs pretty quickly, but as I've played it a bit longer, I'll usually spend about as long on a full run as I would with Slay the Spire.

The card upgrade system is really cool and I've really enjoyed using it, the charms give you a huge amount of flexibility with how you want to build up your deck. You can often put the same damage or effect-boosting charm on items and characters. You may get a charm that applies poison on-hit and decide to put it on one of your fast-hitting characters, or you could use that same charm on a weapon to apply poison to a specific target when you need it. I love this system's flexibility and think it's a great way to handle card upgrades and power boosting. My one complaint with it is that some charms can become nearly useless if you don't have the cards for it, not just because the effects aren't what you want but also because some have costs/stat changes that some cards can't meet (one charm reduces damage by 2 for a good bonus, but if your card doesn't have at least 2 damage it can't use the charm). That's one thing I'd love to see changed to prevent charms from getting wasted or feeling disappointed that you can't use them.

Finally as for game length, it's alright and I think it's fair. There isn't a massive amount of objectives or quests for you to complete, there are maybe 15-20 challenges to unlock charms, and maybe another 20-30 unlocks throughout the village each with a specific requirement. As you finish runs you can get a few more challenge modifiers that increase the difficulty but give you extra bonuses, and I'm just starting to see a few new unlocked mechanics/goals after I finished my fourth win. The daily challenge is also really fun, it has a good amount of challenge to it and I've really enjoyed the weird mix of cards and strategies it forces you to use. In total, I'm guessing I'll get about 40-50 hours out of this game by the time I'm finished with the content in the game right now which I think is great for the price.

If you would be really bothered by a few potential balance issues you may want to check back later once that gets cleaned up a bit, but if you just want to have fun with it I can definitely recommend Wildfrost.","0","1681742790","true","1214","4410","0","13","182","0","0","0"

EDIT: I would like some improvements to the UI in the town however, such as being able to see the starting deck of each faction by simply clicking on it, as well as having some sort of log to see which in-game objectives complete their respective village requests without having to go to the specific buildings in question.","0.503225803375244141","1681739510","true","445","493","0","5","124","2","0","1"

It has amazing art work, a pleasant soundtrack, and wonderful mechanics that provide lots of choice and freedom in how you play. 

While it is a deck builder, your deck isn't so large, so you can either focus on upgrading the cards in your deck, or the companions who mostly stick around in play. Each round of combat usually involves just playing one card, but with freedom to adjust the battlefield each turn, you have so much freedom in your turns, often each fight turns into a fun puzzle. 

For me so far this is better than slay the spire, runs tend to be shorter, and it hits the sweet spot of difficulty for me, that is challenging enough that not all runs succeed. Once you finish runs, you can unlock additional difficulty modifiers, and other changes to make each run feel more unique (Won't go into details here because of spoilers)

There are 'achievements' in game, which unlock more content as you play, giving you something to aim for each run, rather than just winning, so there is some nice meta progression.

I highly recommend this game, especially to anyone who has enjoyed slay the spire or monster train.

The game presentation is so cute, definitely the best visuals and sounds out of the competition I have played. Then you start playing the game and the difficulty is intense. Overall I do not think this level of challenge is unfair, units have lots of health, and they reinforce but this is capped. 

Some small quality of life improvements would help - e.g predicating what damage units will take on a turn i.e monster train. Hoping the devs do not make the game too easy, in response to the negative reviews.

I have 150 hours klokked in for their previous title, one of the best platformer roguelites in existence, and certainly my most favorite. Caveblazers is fantastic.

I like Wildfrost a lot. But I don't like Wildfrost in its current state. This review is temporarily negative until the issues I bring up get addressed. A negative review should indicate the game is not enjoyable in its current state. It should not mean the game is bad, or garbage. The issues in Wildfrost are fixable, but that does not mean they WILL be fixed. So until they are, this review will remain negative.

My issue with the game is not its difficulty. My issue is that it quickly becomes boring, RNG driven, and unfun. When I play Slay the Spire or other deckbuilders, I feel that I am building a deck. You know. Deckbuilding. In a deckbuilder.

In Wildfrost, this is not the case. Let me give you a series of examples as to how a typical run will play out.

First off, when you start any run, you are given a choice of three randomly GENERATED Leaders. By this, I mean that the game does not have X number of premade Leaders it pulls from randomly, but instead, it builds three random Leaders from some unknown combination of traits.

The three Leaders you are offered, out of all the runs I've seen, are 90% trash. You cannot reroll them unless you start a run and immediately end it. You are either offered three very boring and uninteresting leaders, or one of them will clearly be better than the other two. Here's an example of the latter:
https://i.imgur.com/pFGT17y.png

In the above example, Junk is the only good leader here. He smacks back, deals a little bit of damage, and also applies Snow. You can try to synergize him with other characters and items. (Note that I said TRY. This will become relevant later.)

The other two Leaders have serious issues. Snudder deals a lot of damage, but he's aimless, which means he attacks one of the enemies in his 'row' at random. This means he'll be annoying to aim and predict. Plus a 5 turn activation cooldown is slow, and his 6 HP makes him extremely fragile. If your leader dies, your run ends. Therefore you should NEVER pick a low HP leader.
Oakbark is the same in that regard. She only gets a benefit if she kills an enemy, and with her base 3 attack, it'll be hard to funnel kills to her. Her ability grants her one instance of full damage resistance if she kills an enemy, implying she should be a Tank, but since she only has 6 HP, she will make for a poor tank.

When you pick a Leader, you are given a premade, possibly _slightly_ randomized starting deck. I have no idea what that deck will be, since I'm fairly new to the game and don't quite grasp which factions have which decks. Either way, the decks are not a factor for picking the Leader when you're new to the game, as you won't know what the decks are.
SUGGESTION: Let players pick a starting deck pack, OR let them see what deck the leader will start with.

...

After you have picked your starting Leader, you get to pick a starting Pet. If the pet dies, they will be readded to your deck in the next fight, but they will have half HP. In the beginning of the game, this is NOT actually a choice. You get Snoof, and nobody else. I've put 5 hours into the game and only unlocked Booshu, who is just... he's terrible. Extremely long cooldown, weak damage, poor HP, and the fact he 'restores' instead of 'adds' HP means his ability has no effect on allies at full health.
https://i.imgur.com/fOCq4N8.png

So that's it. Those are your two starting choices. A usually weak and ineffective boring Leader, and a starting Pet that is either mediocre or outright terrible.

Once you start the game, you have to fight a mandatory Basic Battle at the start of every run. In STS, you get to make an interesting choice about which of the X number of starting paths you'll take, all of which branch out toward the first boss. But in Wildfrost, that choice is made for you.
https://i.imgur.com/Ubbd640.png

I really hate this starting battle. It's mandatory, it always plays out exactly the same way, it's boring. In STS you have many different starting fights, like the Louses, the Jaw-worm, etc. There's a pool of 'easy fights'. But in Wildfrost, the first battle is a very long slog that will take upwards of five minutes. You can also lose to it very easily if you are not actively paying attention.

In fact, while writing this review, my Snoof died, so that means he's going to suck for the next fight. Off to a great start... even a single mistake will quickly compound in your Wildfrost runs.
https://i.imgur.com/Xgj3pOE.jpeg

After you beat the first fight, you get your first real decision point in the game. The Leaders weren't really choices; they were damage mitigation. You try to pick the least bad of the three options, because Leaders are boring. But once you get to a path split, you get to finally pick an option for what to do next.
https://i.imgur.com/lzlx9bc.png

Here, we have two branching paths. The top path is:
1 of 3 Item Cards
50-70 gold.

The bottom path is:
1 Completely random Charm (Not 1 of 3, you have no influence over it and you can very easily get a useless charm)
1 Companion character (If a companion dies in battle, they come back in the next battle at half HP and weakened.)

And finally, the two paths connect, giving you 1 Companion, and then the next Fight.

In addition to the options presented, you COULD also get...
- Delete up to two cards from your deck for free
- Visit a Shop, where you can pick from 4 cards shown at random (1 of which is always 50% off), 1 random Charm for 50 gold (The price increases by 20 gold if you buy the Charm and try to but another Charm afterward), as well as a Crown for 80 gold, which lets you start battles with additional characters or items in play.

Here is the problem with this setup, which repeats over and over until you finally face the last boss: If you are given a 'choice' between two options that don't do much for you (You have a BUNCH of gold but no Shop is offered, for example) then you are going to walk into the next fight much weaker than you did the last fight. And keep in mind, fights get more and more difficult FAST.

Wildfrost does not give you enough options. In the above map example (https://i.imgur.com/lzlx9bc.png) taking either path is 50% RNG-reliant. 
- In the top path, I will get a sum of gold I cannot spend before this fight. That means, for this next battle, I will be crippling myself by only actually getting two ways to improve my deck.
- In the bottom path, I have to pray the random Charm offered to me is useful. Let me tell you, I've obtained so many useless Charms that don't synergize or improve my deck in the last ten runs that I've truly grown to detest the Charm system.
Only the Companion and Item nodes offer me an actual 1 of 3 choice. And they might also not be good. PLUS, you cannot skip to take a companion/item if the three choices offered actively work against your deck's synergy. You can't reroll them, either!

Suggestions for improving the map:
1. Add a third random path the player can take after each fight.
2. Instead of two unique nodes per path, make it 3 unique nodes.
3. Change Shops so that there is ALWAYS a shop offered before each fight. There should be three paths with three unique nodes that converge onto a final 4th node that is always a shop.
4. The gold given by Gold nodes is not enough. By taking a Gold node, you are weakening yourself before a fight in the hopes of finding a future Shop that will make you stronger. But if the Shop's offerings are bad, your run is basically over. TL:DR, add more Gold to these nodes.
5. Allow players to reroll and skip companions/items. Even if it costs like one point of a unique currency per run, or some of your gold. Take a cue from Vampire Survivors here, which is much more player-friendly in this regard.

These changes should improve the game dramatically.","0.48341059684753418","1681737960","false","319","337","0","83","771","5","0","2"

Note I am not saying I'm absolutely amazing or even 'streamer level guide writer uber meta gamer' at any of these, but this ain't my first rodeo and I get the genre. I also play a bunch of roguelikes so I get that too.

Is Wildfrost a good game? Yes, I think its a good game, but has some definite balance issues. Kinda like D3 at launch, the core is good but the numbers need a bit of help. The Dev says he is working on this, so I won't beat a dead horse, with that said the review is written 'today' cause a friend asked me if it was good and I've been thinking about it as I put 38 hours in over the weekend. Did I have fun playing? Most of the time yes. In that respect even if I never played again I more than got my money's worth and will keep playing until something else comes around or there are changes.

As others have said, the art style is amazing, though I will say there was one character that generated from the gnome-like faction randomly named Nibjunk with the trait Aimless that looked like he was channeling Justin Trudeau from a 2001 party he attended. 

There are some design choices that make no sense. For example health and damage are 'backwards' on the cards [compared to games like Magic, Hearthstone, Monster Train] - in these examples a 2/3 does two damage and has three health, in Wildfrost its two HEALTH and three DAMAGE which isn't the end of the world but I have died a fair amount of times and or failed to kill something cause I've read it wrong. Can this be fixed? Doubt it as the cards art style would probably need to be completely redone. Maybe as others have said there needs to be a 'preview' of what damage/debuffs will be generated when you 'end the turn' by ringing the bell or playing a card. 

Some of the randomly generated leaders are just amazingly awful, and others are completely at odds with how you want to play the game (yes yes, its a roguelike, but again depending on your hero its even MORE random than StS or Monster Train). Imagine if you were playing Magic, and sometimes you had 20 life, sometimes you had 30, and sometimes you had 10. But in any case lose it all and you're dead. You can start the game and then instant quit, but a reroll option would be nice. Or even the ability to say 'I want to play X faction, generate me three leaders'. Heck, maybe let us build a leader with 3 or 4 random options.

In most roguelikes, playing makes you more powerful over time with different unlocks. In Wildfrost it does too, except because of the just absolute randomness of your leader and the fact you're almost forced to take extra cards without passing at certain stops, your deck can become bloated and TOO random. I honestly wish I could permanently disable a few companions and never see them in hopes of getting one that I can work with. 

Anyway, do I recommend this game? As I said, I had fun with it. So yeah I'm gonna recommend it but expect to be pissed off at times and probably realize around 20-30 hours that you're done and walk away.","0","1681736604","true","2273","7459","0","7","632","0","0","1"

Every card always does exactly what it says it does; I haven't once been confused about what was about to happen.

In all my playtime so far, I have never died and thought it was anything but my own fault; and the next run, I didn't die in the same way. This is the basic loop that you'll go through if you're learning this game, just the same as any other game in the genre. I don't consider myself 'good' at this genre; but to the people comparing this to A20 Slay the Spire and calling it unbeatable, I have yet to go past A10, and based off my few hours of both, I would say this game is harder than Spire, easier than Monster Train. Apparently, all you need is 3 hours to form an opinion on how balanced a game is, so with my six hours that should count twice as much I think I'll say it's in a perfect spot to balance out the idiots who put this gem to Mixed.","0","1681730441","true","407","1007","0","10","3048","1","0","0"

My review: 'waaah game is hard 10/10'

In seriousness, this game is absolutely fantastic! There are _lots_ of hidden depths to the mechanics, which are unique and challenging. I strongly disagree with the minority of reviews claiming the game is wildly unbalanced, I have found it very fair and there are multiple paths to victory. There game has many delightful little touches that I don't want to spoil... The music and art are solid. In my opinion, this is one of the best entries in this genre.

If you like hard puzzles, or if you want a fresh take on a roguelike deckbuilder, then this game is definitely for you.","0.520529091358184814","1681486710","true","338","9001","0","3","0","2","1","0"

I've had multiple runs just end at the start simply beacuse I can't stop my leader from taking lethal damage on the very first battle, I've gone back watching recordingss of my play to make sure it wasn't just my own misplays, but alas I played most of those runs as best as I could.

I'll keep playing the game, but wouldn't recommend it unless you like to gamble on even actually playing a run.


Edit: So after playing the game for a lot more hours it has become far more enjoyable, after unlocking even more stuff I find the game to be less tedious in the 'getting a run even started' part and have now found myself consistently reach pretty far in.

The game has a lot of good qualities to it. It's pretty innovative and all, but it is unbalanced as f...
It pains me to not recommend it because I genuinly think that it has what it takes to become a good game.
I'm still trying to finish one complete run, after 5-6 hours of gameplay.
Pretty simple, you have a hero, with a generally useless power up that needs 5 ticks to attack. In front of him, first battle, you have 3-4 ennemies, 2-3 tick each, 1-3 damage each.
How on earth would you beat them ? Either I try to rush them, either I struggle slowing them down. In any case, I don't have time to deploy my fellow companion to build up strength
Even if you pass through the first fight, the next one will not be easy. Let alone if you find yourself against the poisonous team, you can quit the game directly. In 3-4 ticks I managed to have 12 poison applied to my hero at the same time. So you try to think strategies for next time... Maybe attack him, maybe doing this... but you only have 3-4 tick to apply at least 24 damages or prevent 12 poison (which can't usually be done, since I didn't find anything that block poison, maybe 'block', but to get 12 of those before this fight... good luck)
And sometimes, with great luck, you manage to get through, you manage to have some synergies between elements. But it requires luck, not skills...
The only way I got this far is because I've kept trying, I've unlocked more things, and now, randomness is a little bit more to my side. Not much, I usually don't end the first world, but still.

To give an easy summary, Wildfrost is like Slay the Spire but less routes + more challenging fights from the very start. Instead of just playing 1 card each turn, u can also change positions + recall units every turn which adds a lot more possibility.

It takes time and patience to understand, but the balancing is really not that bad once you understand the mechanics. The game does require a lot more strategy and attention during the fights than other games of the genre, as there are a lot of independently moving elements and very little margin for error. There are also a lot more options for plays: rather than just playing cards on enemies, the player needs to consider redrawing at the right time, repositioning or retreating allies. Attacking the right enemy also matters a lot more. There are some rng elements during combats that can be quite damning, but there are almost always ways play around them. What definitely is a little disheartening is paying to get a random charm that does absolutely nothing for your build. Getting a toast charm or bling charm from the item vendor feels really bad. There are also one or two cards that make me really confused as to why I'd ever want to play them, considering they can have a really poor outcome. Other than that there really is not much to complain about. I hope that once the balancing updates come out, more casual players can enjoy the game as well, but also hope that it won't take away from the people who like the challenging aspects.","0","1681718603","true","1219","12087","320","3","0","0","0","0"

However after getting it, it took me about four to five runs to get my first win. The game is hard, its punishing and sometimes a tiny mistake can cause you your whole run. However at the same time the challenge is fun and refreshing. When you finally beat it, you get this incredible feeling of you outsmarted the game, outmanuvered. Even the craziest strongest runs require you to pilot it well! It reminds me of any of the souls/boss games where you finally beat a boss you've been stuck on for a while.

Now all of those ignoring this game because of the difficulty, here are a few reasons why you should still try it:

- Charm system: The game has a whole system for charms that you can put on cards, upgrading and changing the way they work, this allows for some creative combos that you don't see in any card games with upgradable cards. 

- The game has many systems in place to make it interesting, making no run the same, for example the post first win gets you [spoiler] to fight your own self from the past run, making it harder, challenging and so unique! [/spoiler]

I think the balancing is just fine, it's pretty difficult but not insane by any means. The art style is great and the execution in pretty much every aspect is on point. 

My only two issues are:
1. It's Very punishing, (this is the reason why i think a lot of people claim that the balancing is off, or that it's too difficult). A single misplayed card can easily end your run. And furthermore, it's probably every 4th card that has the potential to lose you the game if you play the wrong one or on the wrong target etc. So it requires a lot of consideration for almost every card play. I read some review of someone saying this game is like Slay the Spire but they've cut out all the trash fights and only left the elites and the bosses and I think that's pretty accurate.
2. I also think there's a slight problem with some (not that many) bosses countering your setup pretty well without you being able to prepare anything for them aside from building more jack of all trades (except some rare cases). Compared to in many other card games where you can kinda see what bosses you are going to meet so that you can prepare a little. 

Aside from these two things I think they've really made a well rounded game. The system with initiative that ticks down is a great alternative to just normal turns and reduces the decision space which is nice.","0","1681715556","true","504","2613","0","1","489","1","0","0"

I'd say don't knock it until you've played enough to understand each game mechanic, but I understand if people haven't gone far with their runs due to the steep difficulty curve of some of the stages.

And while the game is honestly very good, it does have issues. The hero randomisation I feel like does add diversity but creates some wildly underpowered characters that lack synergy and mark the start of a bad run. A much better alternative would be having a pool of balanced characters for each faction instead of a system that does not help players starting out this game. 

Another issue I found was clarity regarding turn order, due to the many rows and columns that the board provides and the insistence on character movement, this aspect felt the hardest to master and very important for the little feedback the game provides. 

The last issue i really hope gets improved upon is the dependence on random cards in between fights to build a strong deck. Some form of reroll with a gold cost could heavily improve this aspect, as more often than not I would get characters or items that do not fit at all and with the ever increasing pool of possible characters and item due to unlocks, build identity gets very hard to establish. 

A minor nitpick would be that starting waves early does not reward you any gold, or that killing the boss first also removes any chance of getting the gold that the remaining enemies would have given. I would love a continue option after defeating the boss to gain some extra gold, as i feel like economy in this game is very important to a successful run.","0.523809552192687988","1681714236","true","615","1347","0","11","0","1","0","0"

The negative reviews are mostly a bunch of whiney 'old school' deckbuilder players who expect a quick win from transferred skills from other. 

So you want the real scoop on the difficulty then? It's just that it's punishing, that's it. If you don't read a keyword correctly, sometimes you just die. While that can be frustrating, the game teaches you that you need to inspect enemies and it's fairly presented in how many turns an enemy is before they are a threat. 

A lot of casual deckbuilder fans just think they're amazing at all strategy games because they learned how to play Monster Train or StS at a higher level (Probably with help from content creators) and feel entitled that they should 'know enough' for most deckbuilders.

Players jump in to stream their games throughout the week. They're very good, and they provide better content than YouTube or Twitch. I love reading these reviews on the game being too hard and then watching a player just smash run after run on Discord. Or read reviews that this game doesn't have enough depth, and then just sit in discord to listen to an interesting discussion on factions and cards that could go on for hours if players had the time.

I don' typically write reviews for games, which is on me. I should write more. However, when I heard on NL's Twitch that this game had a near 50% review, I was baffled. The negative reviews I've read about this game so far are ridiculous. I don't mean that as a stab against those who wrote the reviews nor do I mean to say that I'm better at the game than them. I'm probably not. What I mean to say is that those reviews are very divorced from my experience with the game, so much so that I felt compelled to speak up.

I've played a lot of roguelite/like deckbuilders. It's my favorite genre. I used to play digital card games competitively. I have and currently do play TCGs competitively. My home collection of board games largely consists of deckbuilders and LCGs. If it's a card game, I want to play it. This is the best deckbuilder I've played since Slay the Spire and Roguebook. It's freakin' phenomenal. Now, I'm not going to talk about the art, theme, ambiance, soundtrack, etc. Those things speak for themselves and they're great. The negative reviews seem aimed at the difficulty, so I'm going to address the elephant in the room.

Yes, this game is tough. Yes, you will die. Yes, you will lose runs. If I wanted a guaranteed win, I have enough games in my library that offer a 'story' mode. I choose to play roguelite deckbuilders because they're challenging and feel rewarding to beat. I think that's a big draw for most of us that follow this genre. I realize that I may take that to more of an extreme than most players. My next favorite genre are souls-like games, and I always play games on their hardest difficulty. I don't think you need to be like that to enjoy this game. However, if you are like me, then I think you'll really appreciate the challenge this game has to offer.

Is this game 'too' tough? No, absolutely not. First off, I've aggressively played the first run a dozen times by deleting my save file and restarting. I do that with nearly every game that I play. I died many times. Every single time I died, I could articulate the exact reason why. It always felt like the loss was a direct consequence of my choice. I never once felt oppressed. Did I get frustrated? Sure. Learning can be frustrating sometimes. That's okay. But I did learn, and I did figure it out. Those mistakes taught me how to be better at the game. But did I eventually win? Yes, several times. Since winning that first run, I've only lost one run. The first run has several scripted elements that you can take advantage of to improve your win chances dramatically. I found them, and I feel VERY good about my win chances now. For those writing reviews about the difficulty of the game, if you cannot articulate the scripted elements of the first run, then I encourage to start over. I think you'll really appreciate them when you find them.

What about after the first run? I've won those too. I have consecutive wins on the same playthrough, and I still feel very good about my changes moving forward. Those consecutive runs have only gotten more fun and more interesting. There's lot of content to unlock, and I can't wait to enjoy it all. I think you'll find that there are worthwhile elements to unlock between runs.

What are some things I learned:
- Wildfrost rewards methodical play with versatile deckbuilding rather than decks that abuse a particular interaction.
- This is not a deckbuilder where you can start completing runs in 15 minutes. Your first win will probably take you over an hour. Some encounters will last a minutes or two. Some will last 15 to 20. You may need to take your time and that's okay.
- Wildfrost is not like many other deckbuilders. The cooldown counters will play with your brain for awhile until you acclimate to them. Slay the Spire trains you to thing in terms of 'them then me'. In Wildfrost, every character has a different rate at which they attack. You may have to track the separate cooldowns of up to 12 characters simultaneously in the harder encounters. I think that's been the hardest part of the game.
- You need to make use of all of the mechanics the game has to offer, not just the few that come easy.
- Wildfrost really rewards you for leaning into your deck. Don't think in terms of 'how do I win?'. You need to think in terms of 'how does my deck win?'
- In most cases, there are several threats on board. You need to figure out which threats you can mitigate and which you can't. The ones you can't need to be prioritized. In most cases, that's not the boss.
- Cooldown reduction is often a trap.
- Poison is extremely powerful.
- Crowns and charms are busted, and I love them.
- Lastly and most importantly, many of the things I started choosing to improve my chances were not and would not have been my first choice. They are also not the things that I've seen many streamers fall into yet. I learned from playing the game what works better, and it's made me better.

What about some of the things that other reviewers are saying:
- Will I die in my first encounter? Maybe. But that's a ridiculous notion to me.
- What if my leader has a 7 turn cooldown with no ability? Pick a different one. You get three to choose from.
- Are the encounters (like the fire one) oppressive? No. In my runs, my deck has been the oppressive one.
- Does the game punish you for dragging out encounters? No. I consistently win by dragging out the encounter. More of my encounters wins (especially those against bosses) have been about outlasting the enemies.
- Aren't you just setting yourself for a harder next run? Sure. But I've beaten those too.
- Is the charms mod for enemies ridiculous? I found it to be a fun take on the threat imposed by enemies, and I enjoy it. I always play with it on.
- Is there a ton of balancing that needs to be down before this game is playable? I don't think so.
- Is this game worth it's price tag? Absolutely.

Is there room for improvement? Absolutely.
- In game glossaries of keywords and interactions
- Better visual queues to highlight attack patterns
- Balancing bells to leave room for growth in daily runs
- Making summoned allies/enemies less abusive (players summon these btw)
- Rebalancing support characters like Pyra to make them more playable

I'm sure there are others I'm not thinking of, but I can play around all of them. They do not detract from my opportunity to have a great time playing this game. And the devs are already posted that they're going through a balancing and polishing phase first before moving to new content.

There's a great experience to be had here if you like the genre, so my recommendation is give it a try! If you don't now, you probably will later, but you may not like that you missed out on the journey in between.","0.910300076007843018","1681519311","true","519","2666","0","2","0","793","8","0"

I like this game! It's a deck builder centered around building up your board in each game to consistently do cool stuff, and trying to create a deck/cards that absolutely break the game through cool interactions. It's only about as hard as other games in the genre (though it has that common roguelike difficulty curve of 'this game is impossible' for the first couple runs). I can see why some people are getting frustrated though -- there's some balancing issues in terms of player characters, and it's easy to lose track of what cards are about to get hit (traits that affect targeting don't have a visual indicator). Regardless, I'm not sure how deep this rabbit hole goes, but even if I'm nearing the end of what this game offers I'm be satisfied.

I've enjoyed my time with the game so far, so I'd like to give some thoughts.

Deckbuiders are some of my favorite board/card games, and I've been an avid Slay the Spire & Monster Train fan for about five years now. I can't claim to be the best ever at them, but I can appreciate synergies/engines/scaling/etc. In that regard, there have been some reviews saying WIldfrost leans more towards Monster Train than Slay the Spire. Rather than being a true deckbuilder, it really is much of a 'unit builder' that pushes you towards finding whatever components you can to scale something strong enough to keep up with the enemy.

There are some interesting mechanics here. You have six spots for your units, with enemies generally getting an option to attack first, meaning you'll almost always want an option to mitigate damage. Cycling your units through your deck works well enough to recover a small amount of HP, but should generally be avoided unless absolutely necessary. Snow is a very neat mechanic that delays enemies (with some having resistance), allowing for you to set up favorable trades or just straight up outrace the enemy towards dealing damage. Outside of that, you'll find plenty of familiar enough mechanics if you're a fan of the genre that there's no need to list all of them in exhaustive detail.

So the main thing that people are complaining about is the difficulty. And it's true, from your very first run, the game is hard. As it should be! You're learning multiple new mechanics, multiple new encounters, multiple new bosses. All the while you're unlocking new tribes/units/fcharms/pets/etc. There's a lot to take in, and there's just no easy way to get through your first couple runs without just checking your ego, and trying to understand where the run went wrong. As soon as I understood that I should be playing the game more like a Monster Train with a few giga powerful cards/synnergies, I started to win consistently. Just earlier I finished the 3rd consecutive win, out of 4-5 wins total. This was all within the first 24 hours of buying the game. So it's definitely not too tough. In fact, I'm curious to find out how deep the Bell system goes for difficulty, as I could see max unlocked saves having an almost 100% completion rate on clearing the game. Of course, assuming, you're willing to pick the most broken starting hero and not just choose the tribe you like.

So yeah, if you're looking for another amazing roguelike that is as graphically polished as it is challenging as you sink your teeth into its mechanics, check out Wildfrost. It's a great time!","0.541984736919403076","1681705704","true","683","824","0","6","1408","3","0","1"

The runs that die early are almost always because I messed up something. I have misplayed many times and get punished for it. This is a game that will punish misplays, the further in you are the harder the punish. Also another comment that I saw is you need perfect decks/combos to win. This isn't true, most decks can win with good enough play. Although making the deck strong in the first place is on you more than its on the balance of the game. As a rogue lite deck builder making strong decks is a skill. Understanding what cards are strong or weak in the current deck is a skill. The art style is amazing the gameplay is very fun and its a very challenging game. Overall I think the main problem I have is the content. I fight many of the same bosses/encounters over and over so its getting a bit repetitive. Other than that its a fantastic game.","0","1681703051","true","1616","4221","0","3","0","1","0","0"

As an avid Slay the Spire(StS), MTG, and general card game fan, I think this game is fantastic. The art direction, music, and game design are great and have had me hooked for several runs in the same way StS did when I first played it. It's definitely challenging at first and I can see it being difficult for people less familiar with deck building and the strategy it entails but I personally have really enjoyed the nuance to the mechanics and that I really have to think to succeed. I personally enjoy card games for the challenge they provide and Wildfrost scratches that itch perfectly.

I love how each tribe provides entirely new tactics with which to approach each run and how almost every unlockable feels both well earned and as though it's opening up new doors of potential for future decks. While RNG can trigger a negative response in some games when it lacks purpose, in Wildfrost it only seems to bolster the replay value and keep me excited when getting a charm or adding a new card to my deck. I've beaten the game twice at this point and, while it took several runs to get to that first win, I never felt cheated or like I wasn't provided with the necessary info to succeed.

Beat the final boss in less than 4 hours with plenty of other upgrades, cards and trinkets still left to unlock. Loved the idea, execution, art, style, and attention to detail of this game. 
I didn't find the game to be nearly as hard or punishing as other reviews are complaining about. While it can be challenging if you don't hone your deck to single archetype (the game seems to push you cards of the archetype you build towards), there is still fun and learning in each and every run that you do.
This game excels in finding complexity and challenge outside of just playing cards. The mechanics of recalling allies, the ability to swap or keep your hand, positioning allies in different areas on the board to force or avoid being hit, and having a distinct and thematic boss on every single level with interesting and unique mechanics that force the player to change how they play, breathes life into this card game and set it apart from other games in the genre.

Its a fun deckbuilder in the style of a slay the spire. If you like that game you will like this one.

As of release there is a fair few unfair encounters, and most of the main heros have zero chance at making it to the end due to being too weak, but the game isnt impossible. I currently have one win after playing for probably 15 hours combined. 

Lot of cool mechanics and the game is great, hopefully the devs nerf some of the tougher encounters to give players some breathing room and room to try other strategies, because I can only see two or three viable ones right now.

First off, the game play IS good and the game could be great. Even with the limited content there is (nothing a few updates can't fix). 

   HOWEVER, there is a difficulty issue and anyone that says otherwise is just lying to themselves. Is it impossible? No, but that shouldn't be the metric of whether the game has a difficulty issue or not. The difficulty comes from the shear number of enemies compared to damage you can put out. Many times there will be turns where the enemies can output more than double your max damage and it's bc you made a single misplay or there was just no way to win the run to begin with.   
  
  People try to argue that its not difficult your just have to plan your runs really well, and that's true. What they leave out is that by planning well they really mean make almost zero mistakes from the very beginning where you pick your champion. Having such a minuscule margin of error is the difficulty everyone is talking about.

   The fact is that 1/20ish runs will go anywhere near the end boss. You simply don't get to build our deck enough in each area bc there are so few encounters before each boss. You're supposed to repeatedly fail and upgrade your town to have better runs, but its not enough to fix the issue. You can only have 3 'champions' at a time and 1 pet. Its frankly not enough when the enemy turn timers are so short (average is probably 3-4 turns per attack) and all of your cards have either decent damage but 5 or 6 turn timers or do low damage and have 3-4 turn timer. Pair that with the fact that every single card you play will take a turn and the enemies will quickly start attacking far more often than you. 
   
   There needs to be either better turn management, lower ally card turn timers, more encounters per map so you can actually build your deck, or your cards should have way more health. Having to be nearly perfect on every run in a card battler is nonsense as the base difficulty setting.","0.504700660705566406","1681693884","false","314","314","0","1","0","1","0","0"

The negative reviews feel like they are describing a different game than what I've played. I feel like I enjoy it at least as much as Slay the Spire. The art is outstanding. I think a lot of people WANT to dislike it because its a cute art style, and for some reason that makes it bad, i guess. 
The presentation is really nice. Its a very pretty game. The music is amazing. It's good! It's only $20. If you enjoy deck builders like Slay the Spire, you will enjoy this as well.
I really like the pacing of each run. The battles are long affairs, requiring a lot of strategy to make it through. Between each fight is a few rooms which allow you to add hero and item cards to your deck. This phase is pretty quick and you wind up in the next fight very quickly. Each run is pretty short, so you won't have a lot of time with each deck. 
I find myself in a lot of situations where I am on death's door, and I pull through by re-arranging my allies and making the right sacrifice. Lots of times I don't make it, and these are often owed to making mistakes where I didn't know the mechanics well enough yet, or simply left a crucial ally exposed to a killing blow and i couldn't recover from the mistake. There is a lot of information on screen so its crucial that you proceed with caution. 
The combat is complex and engaging, the art is beautiful, and the world is creative and mysterious. 
Wildfrost is an absolute delight!

DO NOT write this off as 'just another indie card game'. This game is the best of the best in my opinion. More fun than things like Slay the Spire and Hearthstone, which are both great. There is an almost endless set of unique mechanics that all feel interesting and powerful in their own ways. Tons of cards, tons of enemies, tons of fun. 

The only thing that might need a tweak is the final boss and how much it buffs your previous time, along with the insanely steep difficulty curve of the secret final boss. In an already difficult game, even that fight seems pretty unreasonable. More final boss options would be great.

That said, this game has probably the best, tightest and most enjoyable difficulty curve of any game I've ever played. I cannot count the amount of times I've got into a boss fight and for 75% of the fight I thought 'this is impossible, there's no way I can win...' only to say in the last 25% 'how is it possible that I'm about to win this!?'.

Contrary to lot's of reviews, the difficulty is fine after understanding and getting used to the game. I really hope they don't make it easier. 

The upgrades/card cloning can lead to exponentially stronger cards and really broken combos a la Monster Train, I personally would have preferred a more linear scaling like Slay The Spire, but again, you can get used to that. This reliance on broken cards/combos can feel unfair if you don't get one going, but with a bit of experience you should manage to pull something off every run and that's very fun. Lot's of variety too in those win conditions, so deckbuilding choices feel rewarding. 

On top of the gameplay, the game is also simply beautiful: Art, music, animations are all superb and made with love.

I somewhat agree to that statement.The thing is that some build is really hard to make it playable(Only attack boost to multiple hit units is ,in my experience, the strongest and easiest to achieve).

These are the list of my thoughts on the game:

- Sacrifice require you to draw into summon to be able to play, weak starter summon and stronger one need to rely on luck to get it and use 2 turns to summon and sacrifice instead of attack boost one turn. 
- Recycle and trash effect is much worst due to the need to apply debuff while generating trash as well as use recycle effect. Snow limitation at 1 to some boss is really hard to win the fight with focused snow build. 
- Most cards are too weak, make the deck worse instead of making it better
- Heal cards are garbage, heal 2, heal 1 row, heal 7 with double damage debuff
- Some card take too long to perform action like 5 that only hit for 3 with no ability(Looking at you leader)
- Counter attack leader need to have more health, regeneration effect or have action otherwise it will just stand there and do nothing while getting snow and poison to death
- Maybe reroll option for the leader ? Having to start and abandon the run feel awful and the name in the book make it feel much worse
- Munch and instant kill your leader if you are not careful
- An egg become injured if I use its death effect ? bruh
- The run is too short

Overall, the main problem with this game difficulty is only allow 1 strategy which is boost attack and multiple attack while other are not strong enough to win the game. The game is challenging and fun but it will be better with some buff to certain cards to make strategy more diverse. 
Desperately need game guide from the game community

This game is charming, pretty, and fiendishly clever. It takes the formula of StS and Monster Train and gives its own twist on it, while avoiding the bloat of Across the Obelisk or the rigidity of Vault of the Void. 

Why then are so many people bouncing off this game? Here are some possible answers:
-The game introduces mechanics that force you to play in unfamiliar ways. For example, there is not mana: every turn you (usually) play one card and that’s it. Likewise, cards are not automatically drawn: you have to reshuffle your hand, which means that you can mulligan anytime you want at the cost of your action. Etc etc. These changes can feel disorienting for someone who is used to the StS model. 
- the game is fair, but quite unforgiving of mistakes. Your randomly generated hero is your avatar, meaning if they die the run ends. They have quite low health, and so you have to be very careful with positioning and managing enemy cooldowns. Similarly, there are quite a few enemies that need to be carefully countered, otherwise you might end up unwittingly putting yourself in an un winnable situation. 

For me, playing this game felt much like ascension 20 StS. Winning feels far from certain, but I enjoyed every run. However, if you don’t like playing high ascension, they you might find this game too frustrating for you. 

But otherwise, please don’t be discouraged by the mixed reviews. This is a quality game, a new and unique entry to the genre, and is clearly made with love.","0","1681688134","true","382","3995","0","34","0","2","0","0"

So here I am with my own review, telling you that the game is GREAT. Not perfect, but almost? Either way I highly recommend it.

The art is super cute, everything looks good, the animations are pretty fun to watch as well and it's always fun seeing something die or get slapped off the board.

The mechanics are insane, there are so many combos and ideas to play with it's one of the few games I'm having fun trying out new builds. I also like that the runs are fairly short instead of hours upon hours long like The last spell for instance. I'm not a fan of infinite combos and there are quite a few ways to make some here so it's up to you to decide, it's very much winnable without those busted combos so I'm fine with it.
Each card can be modified in a number of ways, and it's just a lot of fun to play with overall, but you still feel strained for good upgrades so it doesn't feel too easy either and you gotta make choices, keeping the game tense.

The replayability is okay, it doesn't have an insane amount of content, but the enemies are pretty varied and change from run to run, as does the final boss (with a fun twist but I won't spoil it!). It could use a few more bosses and enemies and cards, but I believe that more will come eventually and it also gets better the more stuff you unlock anyway, and I haven't unlocked everything. Unlocks actually require you to play a variety of builds, so it's a nice incentive.

One massive positive is there is no meta currency, you just unlock more stuff and everything is somewhat balanced so it doesn't feel like a massive power spike. The first runs are rough, but once you understand the mechanics it gets much better and easier.

Just give it a try, 20 euros is a fair price for this if you can afford it I think. I'm loving it and I can't wait to see what's coming!","0.503733634948730469","1681687360","true","290","820","0","45","0","1","0","0"

Edit: lmao but ok for real, here's an actual review:

If you've only played Slay the Spire and Monster Train, the power scaling is between them, but a little closer to Monster Train.
Wildfrost gives you the ability to perfectly plan everything up to the next deck reshuffle or enemy wave spawn, which makes it easier to avoid a mistake than in StS, but due to the faster scaling, makes those mistakes more punishing. Thus, this game is harder than StS for people who often make mistakes, but it's easier than StS for people who can keep the mechanics interactions in their head and plan several moves ahead.","0.516129076480865479","1681525676","true","1209","5053","0","1","0","6","1","0"

The runs all feel the exact same, and unlocking new things doesn't feel very intuitive either. Furthermore, if you do manage to win with a team then all of those cards that are involved in the win are turned against you and removed from the pool. If you do this with most of the strongest cards out there (like I did), then you're shooting yourself in the foot twice: you don't get access to those cards anymore, and they're used against you. Sacrificing characters to buff others is a fun gimmick, but it ultimately ends up being frustrating with the characters that are buffed by being sacrificed, because if you do it twice in a row you lose the card for good.

Played a couple hours last night to learn the mechanics and found myself really enjoying the different elemental builds you can do with the first clan.

Both felt really different, and I'm interested in giving some of the other builds a try. 

ALL THIS without even trying the other two factions. Seems this game has some great staying power and hopefully with updates can capture my attention for a while.

But I feel like the mixed ratings do this game injustice when it's clearly just a skill issue, which is fair but then the game just isn't for that person rather than being a 'bad game'.

The production value of the game is insanely high and it feels really fluid to play. There's also an option to turn the blood into rainbow. 

I also enjoyed the little twist at the end of winning against the purple stuff. Though I hope there is more to discover, otherwise the individual run may be a bit too short for my liking.

Doing so feels incredibly rewarding and drastically cuts down on 'dead runs'.

Wildfrost does one thing [i]significantly[/i] better than its competitors, and that's the fact that it managed to bake a ton of 
options and depth into its core combat mechanics, regardless of what your actual deck consists of. In most deckbuilding roguelites, the options you have on any given turn pretty much begin and end with what is currently in your hand. Wildfrost does something different though. On any given turn, you can reposition and/or retreat allies as a free action, and most enemies only attack once every 2-4 turns, this gives you a ton of freedom to spread damage around, manipulate the order of your attacks, and generally make your low statted units go much further than you ever thought possible if you're coming from something like Monster Train, and you can do all of this regardless of what your deck consists of (assuming you have units in it, which is generally recommended) without playing a single card. For example, if the opponent has a unit that hits all enemies in a row, you can greatly reduce the incoming damage by just having a single unit in front of it. Alternatively, enemy attacks frequently stagger because different units have different countdown timers, so you can shuffle your units in such a way that a different unit takes a hit every turn, spreading out the damage. Alternatively you can shuffle your units such that the same unit takes all the attacks and then have that unit retreat shortly after. All these options are baked into the game's core mechanics, meaning you don't need to build a specific deck just to get counterplay. Furthermore, turn manipulation is a core mechanic of the game.

Getting into the cards themselves, every starter deck has cards to either delay an opposing unit's turn or make their own unit's turns come faster, allowing you to effectively prioritize which enemies you want locked down and which units you want to attack more often. Turn manipulation is another key mechanic of this game that adds even more depth to the game, because if you just sit there and let the bad guys do whatever they want, then yeah of course you're gonna get wrecked. There is at least one encounter that's built on the premise of 'if this guy is allowed to attack, you're screwed'(said boss is also likely the bane of most 'tutorial' runs), and yeah, I got completely obliterated by him on my first run. After that, I played smarter, used the game mechanics better, and I have not lost to him since (tip for those who know exactly who I'm talking about and are still stuck: Kill the adds first, then abuse the boss text to buff your own units. Spells work.).

This game requires you to pay attention, constantly. It's very easy to miss an enemy counter about to drop to 0 or some keyword that actually just screws you over in a single turn without you realizing it. That being said, when you manage to finagle your way out of a seemingly hopeless situation though clever repositioning, timely sacrifices, and perfect play, lemme tell you nothing feels better. This game is excellent and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys puzzle battles and doesn't mind a bit of information overload (to be clear, the cards are actually pretty simple by the standards of this genre, but the core mechanics inherently creates complicated board states that add a lot of complexity to the game).","0.51360630989074707","1681683584","true","219","219","0","6","0","4","0","1"

Right away you are thrown right into a battle with little explanation assisting you. There are several descriptions in this game, which can be misinterpreted. One example is 'Barrage', 'Hits all targets in the row'. There are 4 rows in this game, 2 for your side and 2 for the enemies' side. Information like this should be explained early on, but a lot of this game needs to be learned by doing. Some descriptions are great and worded well, while others can leave you guessing how it works. Early on it shows a crown symbol when saying 'You must protect your leader.' and then later in shops you will find the same crown symbol being used as a buff to put on other cards, 'cards with crowns are always played at the start of battle'. This description is vague and can have players wondering if this ends their first turn or if it takes up space in their starting hand by starting off with these crown cards. The answer is no, they do not take up any space or end your turn, cards with crowns can all be played for free right away. I wish they didn't use this crown symbol when stating to protect your leader, because companion cards can have crowns put on them, and they do not need to survive.

There are not many faults with this game and the devs appear to be working hard to improve things. Keep in mind they are only a 2 dev team. I have seen several negative reviews here often stating after attempting over 20 runs that they have found the game unbalanced. I do not believe this to be true and this has compelled me to make this review. I have only played for 6 hours, and on the 7th attempt I have reached the final victory screen. This game is addictive to individuals looking for a challenging rogue-lite tactical deck-builder experience. This game is far from over after finishing one run, there are several things to unlock.

It does feel like the game is actively trying to counter you in some ways. There is a wide variety of enemies you can face and your specific deck strategy may not work for everything. It might just be a matter of time until something randomly shows up that is a direct counter to your strategy or maybe the game is learning from what you are doing. Having a flexible deck and strategy has been beneficial to my success. This game may make you wish there was an undo button, because one mistake can easily end your run.

I understand this type of game is not meant for everyone. I'm sorry if anyone felt tricked by seeing a new Chucklefish title with a cute art style. I've greatly enjoyed my time playing this so far and I'm excited to play more. I hope this review is helpful and that others can help to bring this great game out of the 'mixed' rating.","0","1681683312","true","405","2418","0","2","0","0","0","0"

- Amazing art work with nice music
- Gameplay is difficult due to luck based aspects
- It can feel repetitive as the mechanics are simple

So I'm very mixed on this game, the art is amazing and the mechanics are simple and easy to understand. Sadly this game is extremely difficult (2% of players make it to the win screen) and it is difficult in the wrong places. Yes in roguelikes you should adapt to what the game throws at you but this game takes it a step further, I rarely feel in control. I originally did like the fact that the mechanics were simple and easy to understand. But this aspect backfired as they can feel repetitive and boring since I had to start over and over again. So I only recommend this game if you are an extreme roguelike deckbuilder enjoyer (I'm serious if you are give it a try) but otherwise probably not a good game.","0.452646106481552124","1681680629","false","467","2632","0","11","89","1","0","0"

Having played a lot rogue-lite deck builders, it rare to see one that is not just another Slay the Spire ripoff. The way the aesthetic and mechanics work so well together is truly amazing. Even after beating it I find myself going back and trying out new combinations of units and cards.

A lot of reviews I am seeing say the game is too hard. Personally I feel that the game is easier than Slay the Spire, I was able to complete my first run after about 6-8 attempts. This game is a progressive rogue-lite at its core, completing runs unlocks new more powerful units and cards that make the game easier over time. That being said, for those that have not played deck builders or TCG type games before I can see why people are having a hard time.

Game is great and hope people are not discouraged from playing it due to the reviews.","0.502923965454101563","1681680164","true","857","1527","0","1","0","1","0","0"

It's well made, the core systems seem solid, there's a progression system to unlock more cards based on achieving goals which I like, the art design is great, and overall I think this game has a lot of potential.

Unlike a lot of card battling deck builders, it seems balanced in a way that leaves very little room for error, which is very difficult but not insurmountable. I find that I can do well with it if I really focus, and make sure to think about every effect going on and make sure every move is played very deliberately. Unfortunately that isn't how I want to engage with games these days, as I like to be able to relax and have a bit more forgiving of an experience, make a few errors here and there and not have that cost the run. I would love to see options for an easier or more casual mode, because at the core I think this is a game I could really love, but right now it's just balanced in a way that it doesn't vibe with me.

Give this one a chance if you want a game where every move is important and you really want to have to focus and think about it, otherwise hold off for a bit. The dev's posted that they're working on some balance and accessibility changes, so hopefully there will be a more forgiving mode in here eventually, at which point I'll certainly be back to check this out again.","0.502923965454101563","1681679367","true","129","215","0","2","0","1","0","0"

The game's difficulty issues are not difficulty issues at all - they are complexity issues. The game is very complex and very punishing. It's often difficult and tedious to figure out the best move because there are just so many things to keep track of. Not only is it easy to make mistakes, they are VERY punishing and can easily result in immediate death. There are 720 ways to arrange your 6 units, and the game asks you to find the best one every single turn. Keep in mind that I've spent most of my time in the early battles - I am certain the later ones are even more overwhelming.

I have lots of other quibbles about the game. A lot of the randomly generated leaders are terrible. For some reason there is a downgrade that you can randomly receive from the pool of card upgrades. Many things are not communicated well by the UI - bosses have two phases and you can't see what they do, or play around them, until you kill the first phase. If you don't draw your companions in your opening hand, you often have to give up an entire turn. Some of the status icons use very similar colors which can be confusing.

The game is still pretty decent despite all this, and the visuals are amazing. I just don't think it's worth $20 yet.","0","1681679199","false","178","480","0","25","0","0","0","0"

Essentially a rougelite deckbuilder where every fight or even every turn feels like a little puzzle to solve. Highly recommend for anyone that likes those style games. But don't go into it expecting to win every run, or even get to the boss every run!

It's definitely quite tricky, but mostly in the sense that there's a lot to keep track of. It's pretty rare for me to die and feel like there's nothing I could have done; it's almost always a mistake I made that gets a companion killed and spirals from there. 

That said, there are definitely a few encounters that are a bit overtuned and could use a little rebalancing (the aimless/bones one for example can be quite brutal and is a little too rng for my tastes) but pretty much every encounter is very doable if you've got a decent strategy for what to focus and how to mitigate what the enemies are doing.

I don't want to sound like a broken record alongside other reviews saying the same thing, but to summarise: Yes! Of course the game is hard! Is it unfairly hard? No! It tells you exactly what is going to happen before it happens, it just doesn't spoon feed you on it.

This is a game that asks you to be observant and adaptive. 

It is a rogue-like, you have to go in prepared for losses and repeated attempts. You also have to accept that you're not going to get predictable card pick ups. If that's not for you? Fair enough, but it's not a balance issue.

I have absolutely adored every run, even as I've had my ass handed to me. It is the best feeling when you realise you can get a combo going with a new pickup, and then trying to build around that as you continue. 

Plus the game is full of all these wonderful little touches like card art changing as effects apply over time. (Oh Yuki, I dream of seeing how big that snowball can get.) The music is stellar, the art is absolutely wonderful, and if you're willing to put in the time and careful consideration the strategizing is so much fun.

It's a tough game, and it won't pull any punches when you mess up, but I absolutely adore it already!","0","1681676213","true","873","1048","0","1","0","0","0","0"

If you're not good at the game, take a look inside yourself and realise that maybe you aren't all hot s**t, I know I'm not, but I play the game with a smile on my face even in the face of shear defeat. This game is about strategy, play your cards seriously (I understand the potential hypocrisy here), pay attention to what everything does, and play accordingly. When I loose, I look at the plays I've made, and I realise that it's my fault. The game is hard, that's not for everybody, just don't blame the game for your own failure, live and learn.

Anyways back to what I think about this game. IT SUCKS BECAUSE I LOOSE MOST OF THE TIME. GG, hah, gottem. No, but really, this is a cute bloody game, where you can even turn the blood into rainbows to make it a cute rainbowy game. One needs to really use their brains for this game, and that's not for everybody, this is not a game to play casually. What I enjoy about it is the rogue-like element and the progression system of unlocks. Every run, win or loose, feels like progress being made. The run has a lot of variation, from your starting characters always changing their abilities, to cool and powerful synergies you need to build to really thrive. I've just been having a fun time figuring out the strengths and weaknesses of all the characters and items. The runs don't feel too long where having to start from the beginning is a chore, everything just feels so rewarding. This small development team did a fantastic job! They've really shown their heart and soul in every element of this game. Give them some slack and some helpful criticism. I've beaten the final boss a few times already and I like how every time you fight it after the first time, you're fighting the evil version of your last run, which makes it so that you're always fighting the strongest version of your self, which is pretty game cool I gotta say.

The visual is saying hello kitty, but the difficulty is dark soul, but you don't revive at bonfire. So the game isn't have right balance between challenge vs reward. You just feeling cheated by the enemies.","0.382097065448760986","1681674389","false","644","1370","0","10","124","3","1","0"

I should write more. However, when I heard on NL's Twitch that this game had a near 50% review, I was baffled. The negative reviews I've read about this game so far are ridiculous. I don't mean that as a stab against those who wrote the reviews nor do I mean to say that I'm better at the game than them. I'm probably not. What I mean to say is that those reviews are very divorced from my experience with the game, so much so that I felt compelled to speak up.

I've played a lot of roguelite/like deckbuilders. It's my favorite genre. I used to play digital card games competitively. I have and currently do play TCGs competitively. My home collection of board games largely consists of deckbuilders and LCGs. If it's a card game, I want to play it. This is the best deckbuilder I've played since Slay the Spire and Roguebook. It's freakin' phenomenal. Now, I'm not going to talk about the art, theme, ambiance, soundtrack, etc. Those things speak for themselves and they're great. The negative reviews seem aimed at the difficulty, so I'm going to address the elephant in the room.

Yes, this game is tough. Yes, you will die. Yes, you will lose runs. If I wanted a guaranteed win, I have enough games in my library that offer a 'story' mode. I choose to play roguelite deckbuilders because they're challenging and feel rewarding to beat. I think that's a big draw for most of us that follow this genre. I realize that I may take that to more of an extreme than most players. My next favorite genre are souls-like games, and I always play games on their hardest difficulty. I don't think you need to be like that to enjoy this game. However, if you are like me, then I think you'll really appreciate the challenge this game has to offer.

Is this game 'too' tough? No, absolutely not. First off, I've aggressively played the first run a dozen times by deleting my save file and restarting. I do that with nearly every game that I play. I died many times. Every single time I died, I could articulate the exact reason why. It always felt like the loss was a direct consequence of my choice. I never once felt oppressed. Did I get frustrated? Sure. Learning can be frustrating sometimes. That's okay. But I did learn, and I did figure it out. Those mistakes taught me how to be better at the game. But did I eventually win? Yes, several times. Since winning that first run, I've only lost one run. The first run has several scripted elements that you can take advantage of to improve your win chances dramatically. I found them, and I feel VERY good about my win chances now. For those writing reviews about the difficulty of the game, if you cannot articulate the scripted elements of the first run, then I encourage to start over. I think you'll really appreciate them when you find them.

What about after the first run? I've won those too. I have consecutive wins on the same playthrough, and I still feel very good about my changes moving forward. Those consecutive runs have only gotten more fun and more interesting. There's lot of content to unlock, and I can't wait to enjoy it all. I think you'll find that there are worthwhile elements to unlock between runs.

What are some things I learned:
- Wildfrost rewards methodical play with versatile deckbuilding rather than decks that abuse a particular interaction.
- This is not a deckbuilder where you can start completing runs in 15 minutes. Your first win will probably take you over an hour. Some encounters will last a minutes or two. Some will last 15 to 20. You may need to take your time and that's okay.
- Wildfrost is not like many other deckbuilders. The cooldown counters will play with your brain for awhile until you acclimate to them. Slay the Spire trains you to thing in terms of 'them then me'. In Wildfrost, every character has a different rate at which they attack. You may have to track the separate cooldowns of up to 12 characters simultaneously in the harder encounters. I think that's been the hardest part of the game.
- You need to make use of all of the mechanics the game has to offer, not just the few that come easy.
- Wildfrost really rewards you for leaning into your deck. Don't think in terms of 'how do I win?'. You need to think in terms of 'how does my deck win?'
- In most cases, there are several threats on board. You need to figure out which threats you can mitigate and which you can't. The ones you can't need to be prioritized. In most cases, that's not the boss.
- Cooldown reduction is often a trap.
- Poison is extremely powerful.
- Crowns and charms are busted, and I love them.
- Lastly and most importantly, many of the things I started choosing to improve my chances were not and would not have been my first choice. They are also not the things that I've seen many streamers fall into yet. I learned from playing the game what works better, and it's made me better.

What about some of the things that other reviewers are saying:
- Will I die in my first encounter? Maybe. But that's a ridiculous notion to me.
- What if my leader has a 7 turn cooldown with no ability? Pick a different one. You get three to choose from.
- Are the encounters (like the fire one) oppressive? No. In my runs, my deck has been the oppressive one.
- Does the game punish you for dragging out encounters? No. I consistently win by dragging out the encounter. More of my encounters wins (especially those against bosses) have been about outlasting the enemies.
- Aren't you just setting yourself for a harder next run? Sure. But I've beaten those too.
- Is the charms mod for enemies ridiculous? I found it to be a fun take on the threat imposed by enemies, and I enjoy it. I always play with it on.
- Is there a ton of balancing that needs to be down before this game is playable? I don't think so.
- Is this game worth it's price tag? Absolutely.

Is there room for improvement? Absolutely.
- In game glossaries of keywords and interactions
- Better visual queues to highlight attack patterns
- Balancing bells to leave room for growth in daily runs
- Making summoned allies/enemies less abusive (players summon these btw)
- Rebalancing support characters like Pyra to make them more playable

I'm sure there are others I'm not thinking of, but I can play around all of them. They do not detract from my opportunity to have a great time playing this game. And the devs are already posted that they're going through a balancing and polishing phase first before moving to new content.

There's a great experience to be had here if you like the genre, so my recommendation is give it a try! If you don't now, you probably will later, but you may not like that you missed out on the journey in between.

This game IS hard yes! BUT its not unfair hard and everything is fine with the balancing. Its meant to lose from time to time and unlock new things to get better chances to win. Besides that the 'Fighting mechanic' is pretty easy to understand and when you use your brain a bit you can win often.

So but what about the game exactly?
Well the game is, like I alsready said, a 'Rogue-Like Deck Building Card Game'. You start a Run, choose a leader and fight with your deck trough enemies. Just like Slay the spire but here you an position your cards tactically. Its important to think about where to position your Leader or companion. This brings a bit more depth to the game.

The Artstyle is gorgeous, there are plenty of cards and other things to unlock.
The special thing here is you dont get a Meta Currency which you keep between Runs with which you unlock things. Unlike in other Rogue-Likes you get Quests to fulfill to unlock new buildings in your Town which unlocks new things. For example With one Quest you unlock the Pet House where you can get additional companion pets in your runs. For every Pet to unlock you have to do a new quest and so on. The quests are not hard to fulfill you get these usually through just playing. This mechanic is quite unique and fun.
There are few tribes to unlock as well which gives you new cards and new mechanics in battle etc. Every Tribe has his special mechanics.

For me its a clear Recommend. The Price is ok I guess. We will see how they keep the game alive but you will have fun with this game definitly!

I like the charming art, the music is unique and excellent, and I like the idea of the companion cards having permadeath after being KO'd enough.

This is a beutiful iteration of the roguelite deckbuilding genre. It proposes  complex - but proficiently presented - system, with many interesting mechanics well weaved together. It is a breath of fresh air and bound to be the new stample of the genre, following the likes of Slay the Spire, Monster Train and such.

Overall, the game is very well polished; the art style is light and colorful, the UI is a masterpiece of friendliness.

The game offers a solid experience and is built to accomodate further implementations by the dev team, which I will gladly try out in the future.

To the point that a lot of people don't think it's in a playable state right now. The game is hard and demands incredible strategy and planning if you want to have a reliable shot at success. Some strategies are better than others, some are more likely to succeed out the gate, and there are some cards that are only useful in extremely niche situations. But that's how roguelikes/lites work. Dead Cells, for example, requires a lot more reaction speed and mechanical skill than I can muster, but it's an amazing game and I can recognize that even without being able to meet its challenges.

Could the balance be improved? Absolutely. Some enemies do more damage than is reasonable. Some companions are nearly useless (though that could be on my end). A couple items do so little that they're not worth picking up. One item even has a 1/6 (or higher) chance of ending your run outright, which are not odds I'd ever accept, even with the chance to instantly kill a particularly threatening foe. But I wouldn't say the game is beyond the threshold that makes a game unplayable or intentionally frustrating.

Wildfrost is a game with a ton of charm, polish, and style. It's got an approach to deckbuilding and team composition that is at least as good as Monster Train's. The art for the characters is charming, the stylizing of everything down to the money used in-game creates a unique visual language, and the contextualization of your hand as a collection of random nicknacks your characters have collected is inspired. The game is truly amazing. I understand if the difficulty is a turn-off. Not everyone's looking for a game where you have to make tough choices to avoid losing outright. But if you're okay with that kind of decision-making, Wildfrost is a great game to pick up.","0.523809552192687988","1681671394","true","375","426","0","10","0","1","0","0"

The mechanics are clever and fun, the art style is amazing and the progression system - slowly upgrading your village to unlock new cards and companions - is cool too. I've just started and already had tons of fun even though I've only beaten the final boss once so far.

Some people here complain about the difficulty but I think its just a bit challenging and thats a good thing. The game isnt a walk-through, you'll have to understand the mechanics and play tactical but once you wrapped you head around some key-concepts it's really not that bad. The game just forces you to think about your moves and additions to your deck but that just makes it more fun and rewarding.

If there is one downside I'd say that the game gives you little flexibility when it comes to building your deck. If you don't maximize synergies and focus on one single aspect of your deck you won't be able to finish the game. This isnt a big deal but I am pretty sure I had a few runs that were basically unbeatable. It is also somewhat limiting as you cant really get creative when it comes to combining different effects but it is still an amazing game.

Its visuals, gameplay and music are all amazing, the game is way worth playing.
Its not the kind of game that you can just turn off your brain after getting broken cards/deck unlike a lot of other deck builders, every battle matters and even every turn matters, the game wants you to learn the mechanics well before you can reach the end. I understand this might make it not for everyone. But i don't want to see this game fail because people can't be arsed to learn it and just run away with a bad review. 
It took me around 6 hours to get my first victory, hard but its possible. 

If you don't like spending time learning and mastering game mechanics and don't enjoy paying full attention to every turn of battle this is not the game for you.

There are certainly substantial increases in difficulty at certain points which may seem unbalanced at first, but as you pick up the game mechanics and get a feel for what makes you stronger and how better to protect your units you are generally able to overcome them. Sure you may get unlucky with your build on some runs, but most of my deaths have been from mistakes I've made as opposed to a fight being impossible.

It's a great game with some mechanics that are a bit different to other deckbuilders and I can only guess that some who feel it's too difficult aren't quite getting to grips with the unit placement mechanics or are watering their deck down too much for consistent play.

Kudos to all the streamers/youtubers who've promoted this, you were spot on. The freshest deckbuilder in a long while and one I'd expect to play for a couple of years at least, if not more.

The simple UI, cute graphics, quick and snappy gameplay underlies a game that rewards you for being careful and planning all your moves out. The lack of a mana system is also a major blessing. Any card game able to do that well has a lot going for it (e.g. Gwent) as mana systems increase the problem of reduced gameplay experiences due to RNG just blatantly telling you that you can't play the game.

I hope the devs do not stop tweaking the game for balance (it does need some) and new content. I also hope they don't overreact to the negative reviews, way too many of which are just knee-jerk responses to the game not being something they can just win in the first couple of tries, or those who just refuse to improve and keep repeating the same misplays.","0","1681667302","true","626","1120","0","4","0","1","0","0"

The game is very fun! Challenging yes, but certainly not unbeatable. I have played 4 runs, twice I got to the final boss and twice I've beaten the game. 
It seems extremely unlikely to me that I would lose in the first encounter and the flame boss doesn't seem opressive to me at all.
On the contrary, figuring out how a turn is going to play out, using different skills and synergies, knowing when to sac my units etc. has been extremely fun!

This game is a lot of fun! I've now gotten all of the achievements and am on a 5-game winning streak!

The graphics are cute and charming. The gameplay is quick and snappy. You need to think a few turns ahead to consistently find success. Each of the synergies/archetypes in the game is fun and unique. You can stack shroom (poison) to decay your enemies over time or go for big damage with peppers (increase damage dealt per stack). You can set up chain reaction explosions with soulburn or stack up bombs (increase damage per hit per stack) for big attacks on bigger enemies. 

My favorite faction is the shademancer faction. You create little buddies to tank hits and do the dirty work. My favorite card summons a 1 hp copy of an enemy. You steal the enemy's mechanics and give them a taste of their own medicine!

The game is a lot of fun, but like any new roguelike, you're going to lose a few times before you get the hang of it. 

Do you quit Dark Souls when you die against a boss? Did you delete Slay the Spire when you failed against the first boss for the tenth time? Did you never successfully beat the Dragun in Enter the Gungeon because the Gatling Gull had your number? Roguelikes are fun because you get to improve and conquer a game where you can fail at any moment.

The art is topnotch, the gameplay loop is unique yet familiar, and the improvement mechanics feel thoughtful and powerful.

The variance in deck types currently feels broad enough, despite what I've read elsewhere in the reviews. There's probably a more optimized way to play than I am currently, and there's definitely some cards/strategies that feel either low-impact or require good execution or lucky deck improvements, but it also feels very balanced to me as a casual-competitive leaning player.

It could use some clarification on some mechanics and how they interact with one another (Strikeback triggers multi-hit attacks, attack phase starts in the inside and moves out and not top to bottom, etc), but aside from that the game is really enjoyable.

I don't think the game is too hard - It simply challenges the player with quite a bunch of mechanics that are in need of keeping track of and rewards through building versatile decks instead of heavily focusing on one way to win. And I for one love that.

And yes they are correct the game is hard; HOWEVER, This game is not unfair. Every defeat you suffer is a direct consequence of your actions or lack there of. 

Some examples that can end your run:

- forgetting that playing cards end your turn.
- Forgetting to reposition your units.
- Not sure how certain card interactions function. (Hitting thorns with multi-attack)
- Simply misplaying.

From these examples most of MY losses are just from me overlooking or forgetting or not understanding how the game works. And that's fine because im still LEARNING the game. Almost every negative review has sub 10hrs by the time they left their review. They haven't learned the game yet. They are making mistakes left and right. 

Now to the negative reviews credit, the game could just say 'we dont want you to win' and hit you with a hard counter fight. Think of having a full multi attack deck and you run up against a full thorns encounter in STS. While these fights are debilitating to your team I found myself coming out on top more time than not, but I can see how people can say these encounters are unfair since this can happen every other run due to the limited size of enemies and bosses. Another thing i will say is that the margin for error is Very low in this game in later combats where if you make 1 mistake it can quite possibly end your run.

Tldr:
This game requires a different skill set and wont come quickly without experience or a guide (which there are not a lot of yet). The game will painfully acknowledge YOUR mistakes and quickly. This game is very fun and a unique take on the deck-building rogue-like genre. If you want a chill experience you may get that after you learn the game but Wildfrost is not STS so please treat it as such!

There's too much RNG in pulling a synergistic deck so the 2nd faction that just seems packed with straightforward value seemed to be the only consistently good one. The 2nd faction has plenty of Thorns, Burn, and Summons which are basic straightforward, do damage to enemy and explode for more damage. While the summons if nothing else swarm the board and are a meat-shield.

When it comes to the other factions, it's as if the balance was built around a perfect unlikely scenario. It's like, if you have this card, and this other card, then THIS card is really goooood! Where in reality the vast majority of the time you will only have 1/3 and that 1 card will actively be punishing you for having picked it since it's borderline unusable on its own.","0.479905426502227783","1681662736","false","687","747","0","13","0","3","1","0"

Sincerely do not know why the negative reviews are so bad, balance being bad is different than difficulty. I have a ton of hours in binding of isaac and Im still awful at it, still enjoy playing it. I like having strife in my video games where Im struggling to play. each time I fast play I end up getting punished which has ruined some of my runs in the second stage, that is my fault. I play card games and fast play and admit its my fault for that cause it is. 

Overall a really good deckbuilding game that I hope gets more content cause the one critique I have is how little shell and shroom cards there are. archetype cards are really hard to build around unless you are doing junk or champion cause champion is the only actually good shell card imo. More content for these archetypes would be absolutely wonderful!

+As you unlock things you dont really feel stronger but you feel as you can explore more ideas and you creativity can go wild
+Wining is such a great feeling you want to keep playing more

=Some of the tribes (Decks) do feel underwhelming but each have their own way of playing which i enjoyable

-The pet system is great when you want to use them but the pet that draws in a deckbuilding game will always come into conflict being almost a default choice
-Being unable to choose more options would be nicer, sometimes you would run into a set of cards that you just don't want but unable to skip
-The money mechanic can be bothersome when you needing to clear all the mobs to get full value especially when you are limping from the encounter (Makes the stronger decks snowball harder [Unless that is intended])
-Not knowing what bosses are coming up next can make it feel like you are ramming into a wall
-Any card games have some weak cards but some cards can simply be a detriment to have or i have yet to find a use for them
-If i could see more of the records of play-through and saving the names of the characters would be great

=Playing around injuries were super interesting and knowing when to let some characters go is a must

If I have one negative thing to say about the game it would be that is has a higher degree of 'feast or famine' design than StS.

It's very easy to lose and not understand why you lost. 

The game really needs a turn 'preview'. Let the user know that the hero will die, how much damage will be taken/dealt, etc. I'd also be happy with manually ending my turn instead of it automatically ending when I play a card. This would allow me to double-check my positioning. 

I also wouldn't object to letting the hero be injured like other characters instead of just ending a run because they died. Let the game end when there's no companions left on the board.","0","1681326572","false","602","635","0","231","0","0","0","0"

First of all, yes this game can and will be difficult, and yes it should be as a 'Rougeli(k)te-Deckbuilder'.
Especially the 'Rougeli(t)ke-Tag' should have made you aware that you probably wont beat it in your first trys.
(Think about Binding of Isaac, Slay the Spire, Hades, Darkest Dungeon, etc... most people havent beaten those games in their first couple of runs, and Wildfrost may not be the same game as these but its also a rougeli(k)te)

2. The games whole design is just gorgeous. Artstyle of course is a subjective thing to argue about, but personally I really like it. Sound-Design is also amazing, soundeffects are there and meaningful but not overwhelming, music is even 12h in still a banger (the fact that the music only really starts going with the first hit is dealt is a really cool detail too.).

3. Metaprogression in Wildfrost might seem meaningless to some people, but I also really like it since it doesnt make you runs easier in particular but offers you more options throughout your runs. 
Tribes feel very different from one another since they start with different basedecks, which in combination with your choosen leader, give a certain direction for your run, but arent fixed, some cards in general are just better with some tribes, but everything is playable. (Yes even the soullink card which has a potential 1:6 chance to kill your leader but will also makes bossfights trivial if used with the right cards and charms/crowns.)

4. The games challanges you to be focused and, as stupid this might sound, in your ability to read and it encurages you to experiment, also it has a very puzzle like aspect at some fights where they might seem impossible, but are actually winnable. 
Sometimes fights are actually impossible, but thats a problem with the battle variety, if your comp is bad against certain things (frenzy into thorns f.e.) and you dont have anything else to deal with it, the run is pretty much dead.
But I have seen this in other deckbuilders too so I dont know why this is a problem here but not anywhere else.

I beat the game only once in 22 runs, but if i had payed attention it could have been at least 4 victories since these losses were my mistakes, since I didnt payed enough attention and because of that my Leader, or another carry-unit got killed (which could have been preventable in every of these cases).
Once you get used to the mechanics of the game (and there are quite a lot) and learn to play around that, you will be able to make pretty funny and/or stupid builds which can easily win you the whole game.
 
That being said, I really love this game and hope more people give it a try despite the mixed reviews (which can be a shot in the head for games nowadays since we are spoiled gamers and 7/10 is bad :^) ).
If you give the game some time to unfold its potential, be patient in battles, think ahead and read, then I'm sure you will be having a blast with Wildfrost.","0","1681659931","true","731","828","0","1","295","1","0","1"

For a team of two developers, you guys really nailed it. First lets get this one point out of the way. The art, sound design and music alone is fucking phenomenal. They are original, has a refreshing palette and just flows so well together. Many times during battle I've found myself taking a step back from the arena just to sink into these aspects of the game. For instance, how the music switches from a soothing lull into an energetic tune when the first blood takes place. 

Imo, Wildfrost isn't as overtuned as many of these negative reviews have set it out to be. The game rewards you immensely for making the right decisions. Likewise, sets you back by a lot for making a few minor mistakes. Yes, RNG exists in Wildfrost, but not enough to determine the outflow of the battle unless you picked something silly like the Soulbound card. Take your losses as lessons, learn the counter mechanic it's literally the turn system in this game (who goes first). Thin your deck out so you have an easier deck cycle. Read the effect on the card and ask whether it adds value to your current deck. Etc.

Don't let these negative reviews take you aback. If you like roguelike deckbuilders, love the artstyle, plays methodically and can take the time to learn... then, Wildfrost the one for you homie.

the game is hard, but its a fun way of being hard. its not bs you just gotta think a bit more and get lucky. 
since this game is hard being lucky in this game is far more important than it is in lets say sts.
since the game is so hard there are only a handful of usable cards which really dampens the replay value and the entertainment you can get from the game.
when you win the game the team you had at that point becomes the endboss (although they are heavily buffed) which pretty much tells you that its going to take an eternity for you to beat the game again since the final boss already is really damn hard.

the game is good in alot of ways but its weighed down by to many factors to be considered a full launch of the game, its short, it does not have all that many cards and a vast majority of them is a pure downgrade to your deck and after 3 runs you have seen every enemy there is in the game.
so for now i cant recommend it, it will eventually be a great game as there is much potential but for now the game feels incomplete and lacking in many aspects.
if you are looking for a challenging game you should pick it up when its discounted or simply wait for more content to be added.","0.480275511741638184","1681658802","false","726","935","0","23","262","41","7","0"

I love this game to death, and it's a shame to see it get mixed reviews. That's why I thought I'd help out a little here.

Yes, you have probably read the reviews. Wildfrost is hard. REALLY hard. But it's not impossible by any means. I consider myself just decent at deckbuilding roguelikes, yet I managed to get the Undefeated achievement. Of course, skill is not everything. This is quite a luck oriented videogame, actually. There are a lot of fun synergies to work with, and some of them absolutely obliterate bosses. Just like any other deckbuilding roguelike, it's up to luck whether you'll get the synergy you want or not, but the game does give you plenty of chances to get what you want (or something similar).

For instance, in my last run, I chose a leader that applied 1 Poison to every enemy. So I said, 'Ok, this is going to be a Poison run'. I then chose a pet that had Teeth, attacking all enemies who attacked it. My general idea for the run was to pick lots of Poison cards to defeat enemies hiding behind bigger ones.

And then the game never gave me a single Poison card. Instead, it gave me a card that attacked all enemies who got Snowed. Having to rethink your strategy depending on the cards you get is something I really enjoy about this game and other games in this genre. After this card, I got another one that applied Snow to every enemy, and so I suddenly got a combo that made it so I get to slow down every enemy in the board and damage them at that. Add some charms to the attacking card and you get a card that, after Snowing enemies twice, deals 5 damage to everything on screen, applies poison and brings cards forward. This wasn't even close to the strategy I had thought of, yet ended up winning me the run.

Even with this strategy, I still had to think a lot about placement. Losing one of the 2 combo cards definitely meant game over. The amount of thinking I had to do to make sure my leader survived and I still managed to keep the cards necessary to win was really high, especially against the Bombard boss.

Wildfrost is definitely a tough game, yet still manages to be incredibly fun. The amount of synergies and mechanics available, especially the charm system, make it so each run feels completely new. Yes, some runs will be wasted due to RNG, and yes, I do think some options could be added to make the game easier to those who prefer it that way. For instance:

- The modifier bells are a super neat idea, but so far, you only get bells that actually made your life harder. It would be neat to [b]get bells that make runs easier[/b], like 'All allies start with 1 Block' or 'All allies get +1 Attack when defeating foes', something like that. I'm also inclined to ask for the Daily Run bells to be available for normal runs, although that'd take away from the uniqueness of the Daily Runs.

- [b]Sliders in the options menu[/b] to modify health, attack and counters of both allies and enemies. That way you can add health and attack to your allies, increase the counters of enemies, make your allies attack every turn, etc.

I don't think the game itself needs to be reworked or rebalanced at all, it's delightfully difficult, but adding options never hurts. I'm sure adding options to make the game easier to those who prefer it that way would really change up some of the reviews here.

I feel a lot can be developed and improved but would 100% as of now recommend the game!
to the devs, its not really my place to suggest things but here are a few ideas . . . 
1: the charm that reduces damage by 2 is too niche, I feel that while it can be used for reducing damage to self-buff sorta things its a bit useless for most runs.
2: the daily challenges are fun and while the first run should be ranked I think you should let players play it again just for the fun of it, I have loved them so far and would like to continue playing them for the challenge and such, keeping the first run ranked would be nice but it would be better to also get another rank for how well you did in the runs that come after, not on a leader board just as a nice acknowledgment of your skill. 
3: more options to increase the challenge would be nice, being able to customize it would be AMAZING!

Gone is the typical card resource systems of energy or mana. In Wildfrost, you’ll play one card per turn as your companions and the enemy’s combat counters tick down. It’s an interesting twist, and a natural evolution from the grandfather of the genre — slay the spire. 

A well balance deck with complimentary synergies, and several powerful charm upgrades will be the key to success. 

Enjoy the ride. This is a fantastic product for any deck builder veteran.

Definitely one of the harder roguelikes, with a single misstep in card placement or turn management leading to near instant death, making knowledge of the game and a willingness to take a long look at what can happen in a single turn incredibly value.

Definitely could use some tweaks to balancing, with some charms and cards being too niche to make into proper builds or enemy cards being too overtuned in certain stats despite already having the attributes necessary to destroy your specific deck. Leader cards being randomized in both appearance and stats/abilities is a great mechanic and it's always fun to look forward to see what you get, but sometimes the attributes are definitively worse than other cards, making rerolling more favorable than enduring a run thought to be doomed.

As it is right now, it's a great roguelike with a wonderful artstyle and soundtrack that will deliver one of the most punishing video game experiences of your life if you're not too careful.

Fantastic game. Easily one of the strongest roguelikes/deckbuilders of the year.

That summarises the basis of this game; it is a roguelike turn-based auto battler with balancing issues. Every mistake is unforgiving and simple RNG makes you lose. If you can't endure repetitively losing, this is not your game. 
Better cards and upgrades are locked behind achievements. Achievement hunting is essential for easing the difficulty. Nevertheless, these cards are not overturned and require setup with additional cards unlocked through the playthrough. 
The highlight for me involves the gameplay. It is straightforward and can be played right out of the box without much understanding. The card archetypes are explained with simple text on the cards when hovered. 
You don't need to invest much time learning it. 

Although I personally enjoyed playing, It is simply not fun enough for me to recommend. Even after winning, it wasn't that satisfactory, since it felt like an endless loop. There's definitely replayability but nothing to rage home about.

On top of a solid game the visual presentation is some of the best so far this year, everything from the characters to the world all looks incredibly detailed and full of life. 

The general gameplay is as expected if you are familiar with the genre, you start off with a deck of cards and you are put against waves of enemies, after each battle you are presented with a trail which provides some possible improvements or adjustments to your deck as well as the next battle. The card combat is really good, it's very fast paced, you can die within no less than 2 to 3 turns and you run can be over, i think is one of the main differences from some of the other roguelike deck builders which makes the game seem so brutal, your heath pool is quite small so you end up reaching the game over screen very often. All of the cards are really good, the formula has been well founded in the deck builder genre so you have plenty of cards you would expect to see in the game as well as some other types of cards. The way the combat works is also in one way or another a new design, it's all set up on this grid with 6 slots aside, you can place hero cards in these slots which all have unique abilities. I won't go into much detail here as it's quite a complex system but when you play the game it does make complete sense. The enemies are pretty tough here, some are extremely weak and some are brutal, i've found of the main issues in the whole game is that its not perfectly balanced but it's something that can be improved quite easily, if your reading in the future i expect the gameplay to be a little smoother, it's not awful just sometimes a little more brutal than expected. One of the coolest things about this game is these things called charms which are basically little card modifiers which you can collect while going through a run of the game, they are really cool and it allows for some deep customization of your deck. The charms can do all kinds of things, such as adding poison or extra damage to a card or even things like gaining shield upon killing an enemy. This kind of customization really makes the deck building feel so addictive and rewarding. The game also has things like a shop, card duplication, card removal and many more ways to improve your deck. Each run does feel very different and I think that's one of the core reasons that it is so addictive. Outside of the general gameplay loop you have unlocks which add whole new features to your future runs, it's a little strange that some features are locked early on because some of these features made some of my runs much easier. It's nothing to be very concerned about, you can unlock a lot of the extra unlocks pretty quickly. Most of the unlocks are very welcoming though and it's very fun finding new cards and features that change up the gameplay loop. Of course on top of all of the out of game progression there is also plenty of stats and details, lore read through and also a small handful of achievements. 

The art and presentation is one the best parts about the game, visually it's amazing the colours and tone is some masterfully crafted and its got tons of charm. The world is packed with detail making it feel full of life. The visual effects are all vibrant and everything is animated and just generally fun to see. On top of all the visual brilliance is the audio design, the sound work is great, every sound just sounds amazing, it all sounds rich and vibrant. The music tracks are also really good, nothing groundbreaking that will change your perspective on battle music but it's all very fitting and enjoyable. 

As for performance, I expect you should have little to no issues running this on most machines, it's a very lightweight game. I had zero issues with performance. I also experienced 0 bugs or errors while i played, it's a very smooth game.
Overall this might be the deckbuilder of the year, it's got a long way to go before it reaches the same status as some of its predecessors but with some post support and some minor balance changes it could be one of the best, as for what currently exists its a really solid new addition to the genre, its well priced, it played perfectly, the art and sound is awesome, its addictive and very rewarding. I am really looking forward to what they have planned for the game next and I hope to see this world expanded upon. A great new innovative roguelike deckbuilder.

I do wanna write some feedback here though as i feel like theres fundemental issues that makes the game frustrating for me.

The visuals look very nice, however i feel like the information give to the player in a match is very easy to miss.
Card text is when its used with icons, it easy to look at a card and see it applies 2x Snowball next turn, however some of the card effects are just yellow text, which for me i find very easy to miss what is gonna happen next turn.

If  a card has: aimless - summoned, if i just glance over the text to see whats going on i see 2 yellow lines and then use a card and miss lethal or my hero dies cause i dont notice which enemy its going to hit.

I think either diffrent color text or icons would benefit the game alot for visual ques.

Some cards can also get so big when buffed that they cover the card's cooldown on the row above it. 

Also the next wave indicator is the same color as background on most maps so easy to miss

There have been some comments about the difficulty, but overall the difficulty is in the same ballpark as Slay the Spire, Monster Train, Into the Breach and so on. The challenge in this game is that you lose immediately if your leader gets killed and it's always close to danger, so you need to pay attention to the enemy abilities and where the damage is coming from, otherwise you can lose quicky if you are careless. The game is fair though, and the criticism that the game is unbalanced or too punishing has been too hasty imo.

This is probably true for a majority of the players, when you look at the negative reception of this game.

Let me note, that I have beaten the REAL final boss once so far at the point of this review and that I felt a big learning curve to that point alone. Let me also note that I played Slay the Spire before this game, so this isn't the first roguelike deckbuilder that I ever touched before.

This game is DIFFICULT, there are a lot of interactions that you have to keep track of when you play this game, aimless enemies randomly sniping my hero or my companion that I have built my entire deck around may have happened more than once. Hell, I failed my first 2 tutorial runs at the last boss just because I forgot a random enemy that was boosted to 60 Attack(whoops). There is also a lot of difficulty around moving the right units to the right rows in order to avoid damage or to kill enemies the most efficient way. I've lost runs before where I could directly point out points where I missed out on damage, which resulted in the boss living with 1 HP. Identifying what the biggest threat on the enemy team is, in order to disable/focus them is a huge part of strategizing in this game, because there are A LOT of active enemy threats that you have to consider as options. Despite the fact that I have beaten the REAL final boss, I just now figured out that injured units don't die forever, so there is yet another big handicap that I had, outside of the information overload on the screen from having 6 enemies on the screen at the same time.

On that note, I do feel like the game is very fair and fun to play outside of one particular mechanic that I will mention later on. You get rewarded a lot for stalling out enemies which may be something others will dislike, but I really love, because it makes you require foresight of what could happen in a few turns from now on. 
The combat system of having to move around your units in order to let them attack or tank in a certain order is a very fun concept to play around, because the situation will always be very different according to your units and cards. Playing around enemies that hit a random unit in your row, by only placing one unit there, or enemies that just hit all allies in your row becomes a lot harder when there are both of them at the same time.
The charm mechanic, where you get charms with special effects to apply to your own cards is also very fun, it could let you create a super unit that eats your own allies in order to draw cards and get more buffs, or an item which hits all enemies with 3 types of debuffs, or lots of different other things that can happen depending on the combination of charms you are getting. All of this makes for a very cute and enjoyable game where you can adjust your deck according to what your win condition is, which could be stacking spice on your entire team, or debuffing the whole enemy team to death making sure they can't move or deal damage. 

Now while the game is very fun conceptually, I think there's some problems that will hopefully get fixed in some way later on. 
I do dislike the fact that you HAVE TO take the card rewards given out to you, it could happen to you that you dislike all card options and that the card rewards actively make your deck worse than if you didn't choose anything at all. 
This is why I'd like there to be a skip option at least, so you don't lose a card reward AND be forced take a bad card at the same time.

Another mechanic that I have a big gripe with are TEETH. When an early high health enemy enemy rolls up with a teeth charm, there's a high likelihood that the run ends right there. You can't freeze them, you can't debuff them with an unit, you also can't just hit over them with a big attacker without taking huge damage because no matter what you do, you will take the 4 teeth damage even if your unit hits for 0 Attack. That coupled with the fact that so many of your units have very low health, makes it near impossible to play around early on. Leaving the Teeth charm unit alive is also bad, because there will be reinforcements coming from the same row, which you suddenly just can't touch anymore without outright dying. 
I honestly think that freezing should disable teeth, otherwise the only counter to them is overburn (which your units also have to apply in a lot of cases ) or direct damage cards which aren't plentiful or powerful enough early on without charms. For this mechanic I believe that frozen enemies with teeth shouldn't be able to bite you back, otherwise there aren't many ways to deal with them because ink doesn't even work either.

Even with my burning hatred against Teeth, I have to say that the game is very fun and I fully believe that the devs will take the balancing very seriously, seeing how it has left such an unsightly mark on its reviews. Although most of those probably come from lacking basic knowledge about game mechanics such as, moving away from danger or not identifying the biggest threat, which to be fair, is very difficult if you never played a game like this before.

I hope people will give this game a good try before labelling it as completely unbalanced, as I had no problems getting to the last boss for my first few runs, getting stuck at the first boss is most definitely a lack of basic game mechanics. You should always seek to improve instead of always blindly blaming the developers. 

(Teeth should still be reworked in my mind, but that may be a me problem...)

This is not a game where you are going to get broken builds that just level every enemy in sight every run.  Most fights you are going to win with only a few HP left and/or allies dead.  You can still get OP builds, but not the way you think which makes this game so good.  You have to really plan ahead each turn to consistenly win in this game.  Bottom line, if you want a challenge, then get this game.

Also want to shout out the devs who responded very quickly to a bug I found that caused the game to softlock on the final boss.  It may not seem like a big deal, but little things like that are what will make me a customer for life with any of their games, compared to some devs who won't even acknowledge you have a problem.","0.525862038135528564","1681644241","true","1241","62000","0","16","0","3","0","1"

Does it get better over time? Also yes. Due to its roguelike nature, you'll unlock additional goodies over time.

Don't sleep on things like moving cards around once they're on the field, retiring cards if they're about to die, crowns (!), Noomlins,...
There's so many different mechanics in this game that there's multiple strategies you can try each time and this is reinforced with the different tribes and their corresponding decks. Will some runs end quite quickly due to suboptimal RNG pulls of companion and item cards? Yeah. Is it really easy (and addictive) to restart and try it all over? Very much so.

It IS a little confusing since Wildfrost has a ton of things in its corner; it's adorable, the animations are on point, there's a ton of decision making and you aren't shoe horned into any particular build line due to how flexible the system is. Lateral thinking IS rewarded which is hard to pull off and is executed flawlessly.

However the crux issue starts here: The game fills the screen with a ton of different effects and keywords but it's cool, you're a big brain Slay the Spire veteran, right? Wrong. There will always be a single thing you miss during the run, some effect that interacts in a way you didn't anticipate and the punishment for this is VERY frequently, an ended run. This feels fine for a couple hours, surely your just learning the game and will get the hang of things. Okay its 4 hours later and you're still getting got. And yes, some of your runs lost have been just very obviously your fault, but you can't shake the feeling that you keep getting robbed of victory by complacency. If only you had just spent that extra minute re-reading the six enemies, 4 allies, and all the keywords plastered over them like deadly skittles you would've been able to win that fight! 

Enter the key difference, between this game and basically any other turn based game created in the last 4 years or so, there is neither a rewind turn button with limited uses to help smooth the experience over nor is there a results preview. So many of my runs lost could've been avoided if the game just simply informed me if the action I was hovering would result in an allies death. Which I get it, this isn't always predictable with RNG based key words like 'Aimless' but if that's the case the other solution of just giving us a 1-use rewind per fight or even just per run would alleviate the complaints levied against this game.

So is the game impossibly hard? No. But is it really fucking annoying? Yes. I WANT to recommend this game to people, the systems are fun and the art is gorgeous but I can't recommend it to anyone because the ONLY way to win is to sit there and read, re-read, and read again as you consider other options. Combining abilities, forming a cohesive deck with synergistic units is really fun but without a difficulty slider like Monster Train, or any fix to the core issue, the amount of people who would be willing to complete this game is infinitesimal. I love these types games and I'm questioning if I could be bothered to get a winning run up.

Minor issues:

Give me an abandon run option. Currently the only way to exit a run early is through spamming end turn until you die which is stupid. Or if there is a way to exit the run it's hidden enough that I've been unable to find it which is a UI/UX problem OR I'm just stupid which we can't rule out. 

Not knowing what sort of enemies are ahead adds a layer of fuck you RNG that is annoying. Your build can just get randomly waxed by a group of units that are an effective achilles heel for your strategy. Why not just show at the very least a hint of what mechanic the next enemy cluster leans on? That way we could incorporate it into our plans which would just be a welcome addition to the strategy cake we're baking along the run.

Having 3 factions to pick from is sweet, but seeing 1 from each faction is lame, let me choose a faction and generate 3 random ones from that faction, the game is hard enough without being forced to bounce between card pools instead of mastering one and then moving onto the next.

tl;dr your awesome game is akin to doing a math test and getting a 0 despite answering the questions correctly all because you forgot to write your name on the top and the teacher refuses to let you claim your exam because their a dick.

However, the game almost feels like a puzzle in that sense, you are attempting to figure out how to tackle the weaknesses in your deck, 'Should you cycle your companion, or wait for just oooonee more hit?', 'Should you put the Play it for Free charm on a an item and be able to increase your coverage or on a companion and allow you to cycle their health faster?', '[spoiler] Should I buff my companions/hero with a charm, knowing that if this run is successful the shade will possess them, or should I put it on an item and hope that I cycle into it enough during combat to keep my squishes? [/spoiler]'. These are the kind of decisions I stick around for and enjoy.

The main issue I had with the game is once you've unlocked everything (excluding all the achievement charms as I haven't gotten there), it doesn't feel like there's tooooo much there and some charms are so specific that having gone out of your way to get a charm or buying them for 50 feels like a punishment. Hopefully, in the future, there will be a content patch to add more stuff and probably tweak the balance as the community has been saying. 

As is right now, it's a recommend for those seeking a proper challenge, or those seeking a single fun afternoon. There are certainly worse things you could be playing.","0","1681630852","true","1101","6822","386","5","0","0","0","1"

I am in love with wildfrost allready. I have watched streamers for many more hours playing it, besides my own experience with the game. It does not deserve the mixed reviews. Personally I put it up there after Monster Train and Vault of the Void. Two of the best card games in my opinion.

The first runs, on the starting difficulty are easy. And I have died 15+ times before beating the boss the first time. Wildfrost expects you to pay attention to the board, plan your moves. Your dmg output and your HP pool. The action economy instead of mana is implemented in a genious way, but in the end, it is a game you have to learn to play as if it was your first card game. And that is what I believe makes everyone think it is unballanced. Your skills from other card games come into this one, but you have to adapt them.

I would highly suggest catching a stream of Celerity or Esty8nine on twitch if you are not sure if Wildfrost is for you. The communities there are awesome, and can help you decide.

Every run is so interesting, the cards interact in so many ways depending on the board and the modifiers on them (charms).  It is crazy how polished the game is mechanically. The run variety is amazing. The unlocks add to the complexity of the game gradually. There are 3 factions that play quite differently. And overall feels so fresh in a game genre where the majority of games are more of the same formula, or not so good attempts to innovate.

If you have problems with the difficulty, then clearly you're not understanding how the game works.

------------- ORIGINAL POST ----------------

I was planning to keep my review for later as i only have 4 hours on the game, but i think it's getting far too many negative reviews regarding difficulty, so i'm adding one positive review to balance things out.
If you're on the fence about the game and those negative reviews are scaring you, maybe this can give you a different insight.

To start things off, with all due respect, i wholeheartedly disagree with the majority of people complaining about balance issues.

I am not a professional TCG player, though i played my fair share of MTG. I also played a bit of Slay The Spire, but that's about as far as it gets in terms of deck building games.

I don't know what people are on about when they say they lose runs on the first fight. As far as i know there's only a couple possible setups for it, and in both of them you can kill most of the monsters with the basic sword card in your deck.
I agree that later fights can be tougher, and especially if you're unlucky you can end up fighting monsters who have a clear advantage against your build (for example, a certain boss specifically counters poison builds).

I saw people saying that already did 10, 20, 30 runs in about 3 hours of playtime. Again, with all due respect, how does that happen ?
I've played the game for 4 hours and only got 4 runs out of it.
Here's how it went very concretely :
- First run : Beat the first boss and lost in a normal battle afterwards
- Second run : Beat the second boss and lost in a normal battle afterwards
- Third run : Lost in the second or third battle of the first area (this one was quick)
- Fourth run : Lost against the last boss

I also want to point out that 3 of those four losses were due to me not paying enough attention, or not understanding some of the game's systems. Only one of them felt kind of 'unfair'.

So all in all, i think people just need to take things slower ... This is a strategy game after all. It's difficult, and sure sometimes the RNG can be frustrating (as with every TCG or roguelite game that has some sort of variance to it), but i strongly disagree with the idea that the balance is all over the place.","0.52173912525177002","1681361909","true","251","1288","0","138","0","2","0","0"

My personal experience with this game has been nothing but positive. Extremely positive, actually. I died a lot, the game is hard, but I enjoyed every second of it. It's just a fun, really fresh game with a bit of a learning curve. If you are sitting here juggling the idea of buying the game, I'd say go for it and see what you think for yourself. Just be ready to learn, and don't give up. A game has not hooked me like this in a long time - if you enjoy the genre, it's worth your time.

First day 1 purchase for me in a long time and 100% worth it. It is challenging but that's what makes it fun. Every completed level feels like an earned win, unlike other roguelikes where you just grind until you hopefully get to a fun/challenging boss fight. 

And the build variety! The combos and synergies are off the charts, and I haven't even played all three tribes yet. I love how there are obvious strategies with individual keywords but that different keywords can also synergize together in really powerful ways. 

TLDR: Only reason not to get it is if you are worried you might get addicted, because I know I am.

Edit: Sad to see all the people giving negative reviews because of the difficulty.  The game is actually really fair and gives you a lot of cool ways to manage RNG / overcome challenging situations if you take the time to learn its systems.","0","1681498819","true","749","4986","0","3","0","0","0","0"

With an appealing artistic direction, you lead a group of companions through the snowy landscape while facing an array of challenging bosses. At its core, each run is about both creating a strong deck and making tight tactical decision during a variety of combats. Your deck must be one that straddles the line of both having a synergistic means of scaling against increasingly tough threats while also having the versatility to deal with many different threats, which proves an engaging challenge. This is akin to similar games such as Slay the Spire, but the margin for error here is tighter, which is likely the cause for many of the negative reviews. Secondly, each encounter requires maneuvering your units around enemies that are on discrete timers, reminiscent of Through the Breach. 

In testing both dimensions, Wildfrost creates an experience that is greater than the sum of its parts. With some added quality of life features and some balancing (note, the issue here is more about the perception of balance than any actual balance), Wildfrost will become one of the top roguelike deckbuilders if it is not already.

Strong recommend

Edit: Upon looking at the other reviews, at present (April 16, 2023), the English language reviews are 85% positive while all reviews are at ~65% positive, meaning that non-English reviews are less than 50% positive. I'd suspect that there's some issue with how the mechanics are depicted in non-English languages (it seems many of the negative reviews are in Mandarin).","0","1681624383","true","608","1497","0","3","0","1","0","0"

The main draw is probably the aesthetics, though the card battling itself is fairly mechanically unique, which is pretty necessary when the 'indie card rogue-lite' genre is currently so over-saturated. It's currently being review bombed for it's atypically harsh difficulty, which isn't at the level where it's worth being called 'unbalanced' or considered an objective flaw, but the game also isn't exactly marketed as the 'dark souls of card games' or anything, so many players seem to have been blindsided. 

If you aren't afraid of having to put in effort to succeed, or of sometimes losing a run despite your best efforts, these negative reviews shouldn't dissuade you. The game is, in my experience, entirely free of the issues that would otherwise justify a negative review- no performance issues, all the systems function as intended, and the concept of the game is solid.
I would like to see a little more player control over the deck they assemble though. Especially the starting deck. I know this is somewhat antithetical to the genre (the rng is part of being a rogue-like), but setting out with the intention of building a deck around the 'shroom' mechanic, and then completing the run having never been given the option to take even one card related to 'shrooms' can be frustrating in an entirely different way than difficulty. You can already choose your leader and pet at the start of the run, except not really because the available leaders are three randomly generated options, and sometimes they'll all be bad, or just not what you want for your run, and there is no re-roll or quick-restart. This sort of complaint is easily remedied though- just a re-roll button, or 'build your own leader' option, and perhaps a few more systems that unlock more player choice as they progress (like the pets).","0","1681624210","true","943","2683","0","11","0","0","0","0"

Expect to go in and get absolutely destroyed for a while, even if you're familiar with the genre. It is very difficult, and in over 50 runs I've only beaten the final boss twice. Wildfrost provides a fresh take on many old ideas in the genre, opting for no energy system and focusing on giving the units on the field a lot more power. Turn to turn there is still a lot of information to consider even with the player's deck having limited agency as units can be repositioned at any time without using up a turn. This forms a large part of decision making as you can move units to block for other units, swap them out, and decide on which lane to attack in. 

If you're familiar with the genre I would recommend buying Wildfrost RIGHT NOW. It scratched my deckbuilder itch VERY well.  It gave me a good 20 hours of gameplay, which I find well worth the investment.

If you're not as familiar with the genre I say wait until the devs update it or the game goes on sale. The devs claim there will be balance changes and more content updates, but we don't know if it will be good as much as I want to trust them. I'd say that there are many tribes, cards, and units that are never worth using, and that the game gets easier with time because of the new unlocked cards, especially Tiny Tyko.

Wildfrost is not for everyone, but if you like hard challenging games where you need to think a couple of turns in advance it's awesome!
Is there some RNG? I guess like with every roguelite, but right now I can win every other run against frost guardian and every time it was with totally different team so there is a lot of variety and while some cards and charms need balancing it's not a lot of them and not as bad.

I think main thing why it's difficult at the beginning is because brain is used to regular card games mechanics and this one needs different thinking patterns since it doesn't have energy and moving your units around is a huge deal.

One tip i found very useful is to focus on getting combo kills for gold and don't be afraid to hit the bell instead of playing the card. Those are probably 2 things that will boosted my winrate the most.","0.563492059707641602","1681328342","true","201","1250","0","23","354","4","0","0"

Pros:
- Interesting decisions to make.
- Fun card combos.
- Lots of unlockables.
- Great art and music.

Cons:
- Limited card options out of the gate.
- Takes a while to gain enough knowledge to mitigate the RNG.
- About 30% of your games will end early due to RNG putting you in an impossible situation right out of the gate.

Overall: It's a fun game that definitely scratches that Slay The Spire itch I have. I am enjoying it, but it's also a bit frustrating sometimes because the enemies and RNG can result in you getting curb stomped without any chance to stop it. That being said, I'd definitely recommend it for those looking for a more intense deck building rogue-like experience.","0","1681619508","true","242","895","0","18","204","0","0","0"

So here I am and 3,5 hourse later I got my first win after 7 or so attempts. That being said I am a veteran who play most deck builders since Slay the spire and have beaten Library of Ruina without mods. I get how many people could have difficulty beating this game. Some encounters are really hard and some are unbeatable if you dont have a counter in your deck. Knowing that counter in your first playthrough is impossible. 

But this isnt unfair. This is a roguelike with progression. Losing and learning are part of the game. Yes it is extremely difficult. Just like learning to swim is difficult. Your gonna dip your head underwater till you learn it. If you dont wnat that, stay out of the pool.

The game itself is fine, has extremely nice art and is quite different from other games of its kind. Turns are played in a way that you play cards, which either place units, companions and scrap items, on the field or have active effects. Each card you play is a turn that reduces the activation of every unit on the field. Those that hit 0 make their actions (attack, heal, whatever). 

With that you try to kill the enemy boss before your boss dies. Your boss is a unit on the field and you can pick one out of 3 at the start each run. Those have randomized HP, Attack, activation time and special effects. Companions can be recalled to be healed, but if they die they´re gone for the battle and have half HP and Attack for one fight after that. 

You also get charms which you can attach to cards. A lot of charms can be attached to units and active cards. So if a charm increases the number of activations that means your unit can attacks twice when it activates or an active card activates its effect twice and so on. You can attach up to three charms to a card which can lead to really silly and busted combos. And you NEED these. The later fights are unbeatable without at least one busted unit. And this is FUN. I love creating busted combos but in most games having these just means you breeze through the run. Here you need ot do this to have a chance. This means RNG is a large part in what you get. If you dont like that, then this isnt the game for you. If you like building the best of what you get with being force to use extremely different tactics each run, then this is the game for you. 

Spoiler for the end of a run:
There also seems to be a mechanic where the deck you win a run with gets possesed by the boss at the end? I dont know what that means yet, I assume you have to fight your own deck at some point. But since I dont have any more time today I cant tell you what that is about.","0.525862038135528564","1681617389","true","198","690","0","41","0","1","0","1"

My only complaint so far is the lack of counterplay to teeth damage. Unless you have a ton of hp on all your units, or you have built a deck that can direct kill your 10+ hp of problems, teeth damage really don't have the same level of counterplay that all the other keywords have. You can't stop your hero from attacking, so when a unit generates with a random teeth charm on the front line the same turn your hero is ready to attack with their 1 hp, there's just nothing you can do. Which feels extremely punishing for 'bad luck'. 

Unlike most other abilities, neither ink nor frost will bail you out of that situation, and you cannot retreat your hero, so unless you have a self freeze or a kill spell to take out the spawned unit, there's just nothing you can do, which is really annoying.

I still love this game, but I've lost several runs at this point to unfortunate teeth appearing out of nowhere. And I wish there was just more I could do about it.","0","1681617115","true","684","1255","0","7","0","0","0","0"

The only issue that you see people complaining about is difficulty. And yes, the game is difficult. But it's not THAT difficult. 

Additionally, the devs have said they are focusing on balance and listening to feedback. So, the game will likely be easier soon. 

This game get's system design down fantastically. And the mechanics (sans very few cards) are clear and easy to understand.

And the JUICE that comes with every Chucklefish game is second-to-none.
If you are BIG into deckbuilder rougelikes (someone who plays takes them to the highest difficulties), then check this game out asap. Otherwise, give it a month or so until they make it easier.","0.523809552192687988","1681612457","true","321","798","0","1","706","2","0","0"

The game rides that fun and cutesy atmosphere as a counter to its (current) lack of balance in player agency and difficulty curve during the course of a run.

I gave this a positive score because the devs have stated they're looking at balance, accessibility, and the difficulty curve in their first few patches, and I'm glad they're taking action. I'm also having fun with the various synergies and strategies that are available. That said, I'd also like to have fun while having a chance at making it further in the game. As of yet, I usually die to the first boss. When I do make it past the first boss (either snowman or monkey) I usually die to the first battle past that point. On the rare occasion I make it past that first battle (usually the purple fellas), that area boss wipes me out in seconds as my party is wounded and my map options unhelpful.

First problem: The leader selection is completely underwhelming. Each leader is a random set of variables that either add up to being a potential burden to your team, or a massive boon that establishes your main strategy. If they simply had a couple leaders to choose from, like they do with pets, I think it would be fun to see what you could do, even if you were still offered a random selection to choose from.

Second problem: The difficulty curve ramps up as you enter the first boss fight, a near cliff face you have to scale with a meager deck of scraps. Each boss enemy has two fazes, yet also has numerous waves of enemies on the same timer as a normal battle, swamping you in priority targets, any of which will destroy you as you try to deal with them, or the boss. The battles that show up past this point are carefully crafted sets of synergies that are designed to show you just how pitiful the synergies you have access to truly are. Better hope you have the right type of deck to deal with each combat, or a linchpin card you guard with your life because it can deal with things you couldn't have predicted running into.

Positive 1: Each card feels like it should have a purpose and a place in your party, even if they are simply fodder to guard your leader in some way. There are many different status effects to wield and administer from poison and curses, to yellow bombs and shells. Each has a purpose, each has a strength, and each is used best by the enemy. Its hard to not frame this somewhat negatively, by pointing out how weak these feel when the player uses them, but they are fun to mess around with in the first stage of the game when you have a chance to do so.

Positive 2: Unlocks are a constant flow for the first few runs you have, before they slowly trickle away as your number of runs increase, but your viability remains the same. The pet system is great and offers a lot of choice in how you augment your usually pitiable leader into a decent force on the battlefield. The art is also ADORABLE, and helps in carrying this aspect. While some unlocks feel minimal, considering they mostly add to already rather extensive card pools, others you can feel the impact of, like the multiple factions. I look forward to seeing any other factions they add, as those add to the gameplay more than anything else you have a choice about!

I'm going to stop there for now. Its a great deck-building roguelike, marred by a difficulty that inflates itself by weakening the player's choices and agency and inflating the enemy's strength by providing numerous synergies and frustration-inducing effects that further limit player agency. I look forward to seeing what the team does to address the balance and difficulty concerns, and will update my review accordingly when they do so. I'm optimistic, so I'm starting it with a YES.","0.494505524635314941","1681609860","true","674","706","0","27","524","1","0","0"

The game does get tough after a while, and I had several brutal failures, but I was always having fun even while losing. If you are reading this and love deck builder games, don't let the reviews stop you from playing this. Burred under the blizzard of poor reviews is a great game. I paid full price for it and it was totally worth it.

Also if you are the developer reading this, I feel like there are a few charms that could be adjusted. the 3/3/3 charm is almost always negative, the bread charm always is a 'worse charm' then almost anything else.... and the removing your charm limit is basically never relevant.  I'm not saying remove them, but it certainly is a 'feel bad' moment when you get the fish charm before the first boss - because it isn't about to help you. I think if you could sell back unwanted charms for 20 or something it would feel a lot better.","0","1681609780","true","2049","3470","0","26","0","0","0","0"

That said, it is far more infuriating than Slay the Spire. For the love of God, at least allow give us the ability to save scum i.e. quit and restart the match. So many times I find that I play my turn and something unexpected happens, either good or bad. I'm writing this just after dying during a pretty awesome run because for some reason, after killing the boss my hero decides to *carry on attacking* and targets an enemy with smackback.

To summarise, there are three main things this game needs:

- The ability to save scum, like with Slay the Spire.
- A way to make the mechanics and potential outcome of a play of action far more clear - for example by indicating the turn order of enemies, highlighting which allies/enemies are at risk of being killed during the turn, etc.
- A lot more balancing.","0","1681609123","true","1523","7040","0","5","166","0","0","1"

Abusing a mechanic may get you through a couple early battles, but lead you to being punished rather severely later on when those same mechanics make the baddies even more powerful in the next battle.

Do not let those reviews rob you of this very fun experience. 

Look, I've played plenty of Slay the Spire and Monster Train, but I am in no way a master of deckbuilders. It took me 3 hours to get my first run win, and in the previous two runs I reached the final boss. 

If you're reading this, you're probably at least as good at deckbuilders as me. Just engage with the game's systems and you'll be totally fine.

The mechanics are complicated, but I wouldn't even classify the game as 'hard' relative to other roguelikes. So either this game has an especially whiny community for one reason or another, or players are just not grasping the fundamentals of the combat system. Repositioning your units every turn, summoning fodder to take hits, understanding the implications of the unique action-based timer - these are systems the tutorial explains, but I have a feeling that many players are burrowing their heads in the sand and trying to win the game 'from hand' the way you do in Slay the Spire. 

Because that's how my first few runs went, and I got rolled. My first four runs ended at or before the first boss. My fifth and sixth runs reached the final boss, and my seventh cleared the final boss.  And again, I am not an especially good player, I'm just willing to interact with and learn the game's systems. If you think you can do the same, then I wholeheartedly recommend Wildfrost.","0.523809552192687988","1681608037","true","178","1303","0","34","0","1","0","0"

Although there's some UX issues I've stumbled upon I expect them to be fixed and the whole game to be improved upon in the future, even though the team who created the game is small, I will be more than happy to support this game and excitingly wait for future updates.

That said, I'm a big deckbuilder fan and have spent hundreds of hours playing these kinds of games, and it took me ten hours before I won a run, and I feel like rng has a big part in whether you get the necessary tools to win or not.

As of this review i have 11 hours into this game and almost all unlocks in town and have beaten the game once but as stated some issues i do want to point out to hope they get adjusted or fixed out right that will make this game better to new comers and over all. I will also state the reason for each negative and leave spoilers out of the review till the end to be clear.

Pros
- Mechanics: out of all the deck builder's and roguelikes i have played it stands out and is fun most times.

- Keywords: All are great and add fun aspects to them except for two of them explained later.

- Clans: Cool and distinct to one another.

- End game: Mechanic on how it plays the first time and home it gets harder is super cool and unique.

- Events/Pathing: Simple and impactful.

- Enemies/encounter: Fun and cool that they are themed.

-Sound: The game sounds great to play with and relax.

-The inventors Hut: feels great to unlock and start using.
Negatives
- Keywords: 
          - Aimless: is fine for the player to use but as for the enemy it feels unfair from as low as sometimes to out right unfair. The reason is that once the leader is low or even has low hp to start it feels unfair when you can't stop aimless from snipping the leader in just the short 11 hours i have played i have had to many runs end because the aimless seemed to only aim at the leader and i was unable to kill all 5 of them on the field by the time they did snipe my leader just does not feel good as a player to leave so many enemies to attack randomly. To fix this i suggest just adding a indicator when you hover over them to where they plan on attacking keep it random but show us where it is landing if the players line up stays the same if changed because of another attack changing the players lay out then the enemy changes target location or something to the like allowing it to feel a bit more fair because i knew where it was attacking or have a bit less enemies with aimless 
          - Overburn: To be fair over burn on allies are fine and the enemies that have it is also fine the issue is mainly the ending and how that works knowing that i had a god run as my 4-5 run where i beat the final boss with no issue but now with the endgame mechanic i'm stuck with dealing with a over HP god run boss that once he gets to attack i loss because the amount of overburn i get in that one attack it is just over( to be clear my boss has 54hp and 8 overburn with barrage and with most allies and leaders having low hp pools that's a wipe on that row but the other allies also are problems with 2 willows, berry sis with teeth charm, big berry, 2 plums, and 2 Vesta's (glad they lost double overburn)don't know if hp matters for allies but you try to kill this team before they can attack i wait.) the issue is that overburn on a player is fine but keeping as high on the final boss is bafulling and currently ended 10 runs a few with ink but not a good way to obtain make sit to hard to have by then. My suggestion just if they have overburn half the amount.

- Clans: Clans are great the issue comes with the cards you can get because you have 3 clans but dont lock off the cards that arnt from the leaders clan leads to too many different archetypes competing to be in the players deck it's a simple fix  by having all allies you save being a 2/3 being from the players selected leader at all times making it be more consistent for the playes deck and there skill being needed to beat each fight not luck on a good ally being in the deck and not junk compared to your leader just sucks having a game where i only got allies that apply demonize but have only low attack leaders that dont really get to take advantage of it.

-Store/event: The only issue that i have is that it feels a bit odd that the store sells random charms and the event sells them out right i feel like either the store should also sell charms out right just 1-2 or they should switch this is just a personal thing and i know that don't know how others feel about it just does not make since to me that the store does not sell any at all.

-Leader: The leader system is cool but i feel like you need to give the player a additional reward for there leader when completing a boss where they get stronger and not just the game charm this mainly comes from me having an issue with the final boss i have right now just a small increase like they get more damage because they found a better weapon more health because better cloths or food for more energy to attack sooner and then remove the ability to add charms or restrict it to 1 or something similar may need a good amount of testing but it just sucks having a leader that dies in one hit late game.

-Charms: only issue is having no way of getting rid of charms you won't/cant use, allow us to sell them because having a scrap charm when your deck is summons based. Sucks even more when you don't even see another way to allow you to use it.

-Boss Charm: I don't know if they are more because of said issue but the first one should only affect 1 ally each fight because i lost a few match's where a minion with 9 attack got frenzy and was in the back line while one with teeth charm was in the front just felt unfair that the enemy had more charms then i did and since they are all minion related they are almost all better for them unlike my charm that i got randomly that i could not use yet.

- Unlocks: the unlocks don't feel great to unlock because they don't really impact your run as they should so far i have only bought one from a store and have yet to choose one for my deck because they don't seem as impactful as they should be.

-Pets: pets feel fine but i feel like they need a bit more adjustment they should be a good ally but feel like garbage and a waste of a turn sometimes to play.

-Hot Spring: Most of these allies feel bad to use in most cases considering you had to unlock them and they are barely as good as other allies you already have. 

I really like this game and want it to be great so i'm posting this as a thing to know about and can look into at least to improve the game but being a game designer i understand the troubles of balance and designing but keep it up you guys have a great game here and i want to keep playing it.

Writing this review to offset all the people complaining about this game being impossible. The game is incredibly fun and challenging. But not even close to being 'too difficult' to win. The game is very charming and rewarding. The progression system keeps you engaged and the game is constantly evolving. The cards you get at the first couple playthroughs are probably not the cards you'll end up winning with, but thats by design. It teaches you how brutal the mechanics can be if you aren't paying attention or prepared. Once the better cards become available, you'll appreciate their power more and be able to recognize what is truly strong vs weak. And the playtime required to get the better cards is very forgiving. Only 3.5 hours compared to games like Marvel snap, which take over 100 hours to even begin playing the game like other people can.

Most mistakes feel very punishing and hard to recover from which makes you focus on most decisions.
There seems to be tons of varieties to be had with the different factions and tons of different main characters randomized for each run. Some of these options are very easy to master but some way way way less so.

Unfortunately like many people say there are some balance issues and some runs are guaranteed lost early cause there was nothing else that you could do provided with what the run got you.
While this is a factor in other roguelites like Slay the Spire that many people compare it to, it isn't nearly as prevalent there as it is in this game.

When it comes to locations that you visit during your run, it feels like that is one of the games greatest shortcomings.
Because the power level that they provide to the team is also very drastic.
You pretty much always want to upgrade your cards, if that location isn't available then you want to get money so that you potentially can get a shop so that you can upgrade your cards even more. 
But there are some terrible upgrades in the sense that they are extremely situational like reducing the attack of your cards and giving a special type of hp that only can be applied to certain creatures.
Getting good upgrades feel essential for a good run cause some of the upgrades are really awesome
Some locations are unlocked later in the game that gives you some options, but from my experience upgrades are key.

Even after all these negative aspects, I'm still enjoying myself. Combat feels like a puzzle because you don't want your allies to die because then the next fight will be harder and you don't want your main character to tank too much and die because then the run is over. When it all looks over and you realize that you can survive one turn more and it just snowballs into a win is one of the best feelings to have in this game,
You move around your team constantly to get the best types of attack and defense, it just works so well!

If you get this game, try to go in with an open mind and don’t expect to get a win or go very far. There is some rng that can feel devastating, like the enemy having a single minion that can wipe your entire team cause you had no way to play around it or even worse that the enemy makes 3 random attacks and your main character goes from full hp to zero resulting in a loss. But in the end all you can do is try again until it works.

This game definitely doesn't deserve to have Mixed reviews cause it can be so much fun and it has tons of potential.


Hopefully the devs will listen to the community and balance it out by making it feel more fair, opening up more strategic options while maintaining most of the difficulty.","0","1681602002","true","401","439","0","2","264","0","0","0"

Despite this I would still recommend this game because it is enjoyable, I have still felt like I've been progressing by unlocking new cards and getting further with each run. The combat system is very unique and forces you to think much harder about your moves and deck building.

I bought it anyway and still gave it a shot, if it really was too hard I could just refund it and move on. Turns out, this game from run to run is the most engaging card battler that I have played since INSCRYPTION, a game that is purely story based and meant to be balanced around you only playing about 3 hours of each act to beat the game. The game for sure is challenging, and *possible?* that maybe it is too challenging, but the developers seemed to have put a good deal of effort into making each combat new and refreshing. The mechanics that both the enemies have and that your heros have are both inventive and exciting. 

Another aspect of the game that I can't possibly fathom someone wanting to leave a negative review after seeing, is the absolutely rich and refined kind of cartoony art style that they went with. The cards don't seem samey at all and all evoke their own personalities based on the effects that the card has. 

Another plus is the progression system that allows you to unlock all sorts of things after completing 'achievements' that cover almost every single aspect of the game so every single run is different from one to the next for seemingly countless amounts of hours.

I can't wait to play more after only 4 hours of playing. If you have enjoyed card battlers in the past, give this one a shot. Seriously.","0","1681599940","true","246","1578","0","6","315","0","0","0"

When you consider rerolling instead of working with the tools you are given, because they will inadvertently fail once the difficulty ramps up, then something is seriously off.  

Back to the drawing board?

Edit, after 20+ hours: I have completed almost everything there is to do and experience, don't know how to go about getting the 6-kill combo thing and the bs achievments, but frankly I don't care anymore. The point is that on top of being an unbalanced mess, which you can only beat by going for the cheesiest (and most boring) of strats, this has almost no replayability, even though the game specifically claims that for itself. Card pool is actually really small, good card pool is tiny. Same goes for charms.

- The counter mechanic is a unique twist to the genre that heavily rewards players that plan multiple turns ahead and put in attention to detail (which order to play cards, how to position your units, etc.). There's lots of interesting strategy and optimizations in every combat as a result. 

- The overall look and feel of the game are outstanding. Beautiful artwork, animations, UI, soundtrack, and so on. Simply put, playing cards feels good.

- This is apparently contentious, but the game feels incredibly balanced. As of this writing, I have ~18 hours in the game. By 'balanced', what I mean is:
    - There's a wide variety of possible strategies. In some decks, you'll aim to kill enemies as fast as possible, while in others you'll play more defensively and drag out the encounter. Both styles feel powerful and have their own sets of pros and cons. 
    - Every card has it's time and place to shine, and it's on the player to figure out when.
    - In dozens of defeat, there hasn't been a single one that I felt like couldn't have been avoided with better play on my part. The game is incredibly fair in this regard.

Overall, there's just so many great things going on with this game that whether the outcome of a given run is Victory or Defeat is sort of besides the point for me.

Let's get two things out of the way: 

1) The game is difficult and not going to be for newcomers to the rogue-like deck building genre. There are easier games out there to start with.

2) The User Interface (UI) design on what is going to happen in a turn needs a lot of work. Most of my losses are simply because either I didn't carefully read every single card / forgot an enemy had an ability or because I moved to play a card, changed my mind, but didn't place it perfectly back into my hand causing it to go off anyway. 

And let's be clear, that second one is a big deal. I believe the devs can make huge improvements to the UI that will let you know when you're about to accidentally end your run or that a unit is about to die.

However, beyond that the game is simply fantastic. It has multiple clever mechanics and the rarely seen negative feedback loop; which is to say the more you win by the harder the game gets. This goes against what some people consider to be 'a good game.' I get that it isn't for everyone, but it adds a fantastic layer of depth for seasoned strategy veterans. It isn't enough to just 'win' at Wildfrost. Ideally you want to win by 'as little as possible' or via a method you are confident you can counter later. Ergo, instead of building the most unstoppable deck of all time, your goal may actually be to take just enough to be confident to win, which you know you will then be able to top later.

My hint for those struggling is to focus on your cards, not your companions for charms as much as you can. I'm not saying never place a charm on a companion or hero, but rather to consider the consequence of doing so when *spoiler alert* you'll have to face that companion in the next run with massive upgrades.

Beyond that, it's a deep and difficult game with staggeringly good art and theme. I believe if they sort the UI design out this is a 90%+ avg game. My only hope is they don't focus too heavily on the difficulty curve and ignore the larger problem of user experience (UX).","0.523809552192687988","1681598888","true","690","1858","0","21","0","2","0","0"

Though I will say that it might be less due to wild RNG and more that the game is actually TOO tightly balanced. There's very little wiggle room in what you can do with your deck in the run up to the first major boss, and sometimes the second depending on your luck.

If you can get past that, then your build starts to get an identity and the game is actually fun.

This is where I think a lot of player frustration is coming from. It's not fun to repeatedly build a starter deck and not get to actually do much beyond put snow on enemies. 

The balance I think it needs is:

- One extra 'simple' fight in each of the earlier areas to let you get an actual feel for the deck you're making
- Some more option to add cards to your deck and a more reliable way to trim your deck (also please, for the love of all that is holy, let me skip taking cards if they're all garbage for my deck)
- More, and more interesting, leader options at the start of runs. Three for each tribe, rather than one for each of the three tribes.
- A way to lower the constant reliance on being frozen that all bosses have.

[b]Original Review[/b]

[b]Note: I've won a couple of runs, I'm not just bad at this game.[/b]

Maybe the most RNG deckbuilder I've ever played.  You will often run into a wall of enemies your team can't fight because you don't have the one specific card type that counters them.

Example: Third fight in the run. I have been able to pick TWO additional cards from six options so far this run:

Got a guy that gives teeth (damage when hit) to all his teammates but he's sat at the second row (behind someone else I have to kill first to hurt him). My range cards do two damage and the enemy has 14 health. 

I can't fight the enemies in front of him as they have teeth that hurt me, and I can't hurt him as I don't have a yank or long range damage card as none have been offered to me. I just lose.

The art/sound is 11/10. Should have been early access to get balanced properly before 1.0.","0.558225274085998535","1681390123","false","433","1333","0","37","0","10","0","0"

However: it's entirely unfair to negative-review bomb a game to this degree. When I want somethings' reputation to suffer, it's because the product is failing to function as a game: crashing, undeveloped, you know, it feels like crap and plays like crap

This game runs clean, all content is extremely well implemented and balanced, and the charming atmosphere is polished to a standard that most game studios never achieve. This game is well-loved and well worth the price, especially the soundtrack. There are many effective deck-strategies that are as fun as they are different from another. What I'm trying to say is, the reviews requesting balance changes appear to be from a misguided consensus conversation happening elsewhere, probably on a reddit, because it's not reflected here in the game.

The reasons for the disconnect between players and the games current state are better explained by the two problems that are confusing players. 

1. Many mechanics are simply not clearly explained, leaving the player surprised at the results of some actions listed on the cards. This is a serious issue, I've had entire runs ruined by a single turn and it was frustrating to learn 'the hard way' how something works. This problem can be fixed easily and the developer will likely straighten the verbiage out soon. Keep in mind that smaller game studios will have these issues without a AAA QA team, Not worth a negative review though.

2. There is a steep learning curve using aforementioned unclear mechanics. This problem becomes far less punishing after you've unlocked most of the content after several runs. I've won multiple times now but only after many losses. This is also a serious problem and likely why players are bouncing off the game. Expect your first runs to be losses . My recommendation would be for the developer to create a shorter adventure track that earns double rewards until you unlock the second tribe, just to give newer players a fair shot at beating the entire gameloop before they hit the grind.

Despite those problems, this game is immensely satisfying and rewards clever planning and synergizing
I hope this review can persuade you that this is a diamond of a deckbuilder currently buried beneath a pile of snow. The reviews telling you it's an unbalanced mess, i.e 'the game is doomed because the foundation of balance is crap from the beginning', are totally inaccurate. If you're a Slay The Spire fan and want something new, this game is it.

As for the game, great visuals and cool mechanics for the final bosses. Most of the decks I've tried are more unit focused, so this plays more like an RPG than a traditional roguelike deckbuilder, but I haven't had a spell-centric run yet.

Due to that, instead of playing the style I feel like, I feel that I'm constantly pushed to either switch styles every run or reset until I get a decent leader (which takes a lot of steps for something the equivalent of a reroll button) This is especially frustrating when trying to unlock everything or hunt achievements.","0.438654184341430664","1681596806","false","3828","11447","0","15","0","3","0","0"

I truly, truly cannot begin to understand the conclusion that many of these reviews draw; that the game is unbalanced and overtuned. It makes me wonder if Faster than Light came out now a days, would it be met with similar review scores? My experience with both games was fairly similar, struggling to get very far until I learned the ins and outs, but then performing quite consistently after that.

There are some aspects that I can understand not being to everyone's tastes. The game is punishing, even a small mistake could easily end a run due to how the leader system works. If you go too specific with your build you might run into an encounter that you are not suited to deal with, but too general and you may not have the power to win. Your chosen leader can easily end up being the weakest aspect of your deck, becoming a burden you must drag to victory rather than some heroic figure. I loved all of this, so I find it unfair to point these out as flaws, as many reviews have.

I won my first run at around 3 hours in, I had a very strong and highly synergistic deck. A few more hours of playtime I was able to win again, this time with an unimpressive and quite generic deck. I found the difficulty to be on point, and was very happy with the unlockable modifiers that can be applied to make runs more challenging once you get the hang of the base level.

The art and music are top notch, the game feel is wonderful, the roguelike progression is good, with a variety of unlocks.

I guess the game is not for everyone, but it certainly is for me.","0.523809552192687988","1681596278","true","1422","3493","0","4","0","1","0","0"

First off, the game is beautiful and charming with great characters and a great soundtrack. I'm not typically a rougelite player as repetitiveness gets boring for me but I've spent a lot of time on STS and its mods so I'm not new to the genre either. 
To address the elephant in the room; NO, I honestly don't think the game is too hard. I've been able to win multiple runs and was even top 3 in the global rankings for a daily challenge but despite that I've had my fair share of early losses and even lost to the first fight once. I've seen a lot of reviews complain about balance and unfairness but I actually really enjoy the games system and difficulty rating, it encourages creativity and really forces you to think about your actions.
The comments do make some good points though, in particular the RNG can be extremely frustrating. Every once in awhile, I find that every option for a starting hero is just straight up useless to the point where I find myself knowing the run is doomed before I even finish the first encounter (seriously I once got a run where every option had a 6 counter, the best being a 2/10, and none of them had positive effects!) The best runs are when your hero actually feels useful and you build a deck that takes advantage of their skills and synergies. But that brings me to my other point, I just really wish there were more opportunities to round out your deck (more fights or random events like STS or something) because you really only get 2-3 choices between each fight and often times 1-2 of those choices actively makes your deck worse with unskippable and unsynergistic junk. When you barely win the last fight and are looking for something to boost your power going into the boss but you get a strawberry charm with no consume items in your deck its quite frustrating.
Even though I've spent a bit agreeing with some of the balancing struggles I don't think the game deserves all the negative reviews. It can certainly be frustrating at times but it really does result in an enjoyable and rewarding experience. I really suggest you pick it up if you are into deck builders and difficult games but if not maybe just wait a bit for the updates the devs already said they are working on. The game can definitely benefit even just from a difficulty setting or some updates to the random hero system but the current game is still a great time and I want to thank the devs for all the time they put into it!","0","1681595976","true","545","1011","0","4","0","0","0","0"

The last 5 games I lost were losses because I made a stupid mistake. The game is difficult, but fair in that regard, it is also very good. I do think however, that it would profit greatly from more customization, i.e. rerolls, the ability to choose a keyword that will appear more often (poison, curse, teeth, etc.) or simply having the choice of more starters, so if you want a special build, you dont ahve to kill 12 runs to get the right hero for it (the dungeon beneath did that very good imo, you either have the 3 randoms or you can build your starter yourself). I think that would solve most problems I have personally encountered, I think the problem with replayability (after 50 hours or so) can be solved with ascension and a modding workshop, as with slay the spire.

It looks amazing, sounds amazing, and the gameplay is fresh and fun. There is a lot things to discover / challenges to beat, but the meta progression focuses on unlocking new cards, rather than making things easier, which I really like.

Every roguelike deckbuilder will be compared to slay the spire, I guess, but the games feel way different. So even if you don't like StS, I think its worth giving a shot.

Edit: The game gets a lot of negativity because people are struggeling, blaming the games balance.
In my opinion, the game is well balanced. There are 3 main issues:
1. The game looks super cute, which people associate with the game being casual and easy, which it is not supposed to be. It is meant to be diffiult.
2. The game has a lot of complexity in the core gameplay, since there are a lot of characters acting at once. This gives the game a naturally steep learning curve
3.  People often focus on 'Themes' in builds, rather than trying to solve problems. When you pick your third poison (shroom) card while your team doesn't struggle to deal damage, but to survive, you are creating issues for your deck","0.506911635398864746","1681310538","true","142","6362","0","3","0","2","0","0"

This game has a lot going for it so far so I'll make a list, not in any particular order:

1.) Decent amount of replayability
2.) GORGEOUS artstyle
3.) Fun & Reactive (?) animated UI to match the cartoon-ish aesthetic 
4.) Easy to learn with a lot to expand on.
5.) Challenging gameplay (you will wipe A LOT) , but enough to have me saying 'ok, 1 more run', a few times in a row.
6.) Starting Heros have randomized abilities & stats
7.) Procedurally generated Map
8.) Combat system feels fresh but also familiar at the same time.

I could go on, but I recommend just trying it for yourself. If you're a fan of card battlers like StS or Monster Train, you'll probably like this one too.

It has fully uprooted my usual very absent-minded playstyle in these games and made me slow down and focus on everything that is happening every turn, and I adore being this engaged in a singleplayer card game again.

It is very challenging, but feels incredible to succeed at once you start getting into the flow of things.
The mechanics are very simple to understand and the encounters are varied but I will say that there have been a few that made me go 'Well, this just counters the entire strategy I focused on.' but it also made me realize that because of the redraw system this game has, it lets you build multiple different strategies in the same deck to great effect and avoid situations like that altogether. 

If this game gets more content over time it'll stand confidently tall among the greats of this genre, for sure. But even without those hypotheticals, it's a FANTASTIC time.

The audiovisual presentation is fantastic - all the card arts are simply too cute, the UI is sleek and smooth and I can still hear the battle music an hour after having finished my last run.

However, the mechanics aren't too deep so I can see it getting stale fairly quickly. In addition, I feel like the game is perhaps too unforgiving at times: I find myself skipping some of the builds because they're 'too slow', meaning that I have to focus on generating value quickly and can't allow myself to try to collect cards for some of the build that take a while to get going.

Still, I'd recommend giving the game a try. From what I've seen in the dev posts, they are planning some Quality of Life improvements and perhaps further patches, so I can see the game improving over time to alleviate my concerns.

I really liked slay the spire and this game looked similar enough that I gave it a shot. I am glad that I did. Only played it for 9 hours so far, beat the game only once. So its not easy and sometimes you get surprised by how abilities interact, but you die and you learn. So this is not an easy game, but dang its fun. There are many different ways you can go about finding a win condition and so far few runs looked similar (You have to make work what you get and the choices didnt feel forced, but I dont know what I am doing yet). Kind of like when I started with slay the spire, until you figure out what works and what the great synergies are. The artstyle is cute and I like it.

Now first off is Wildfrost a good game?

Very. It is quite fun and really makes you think.

Is the balance flawed?

Very.

Some builds simply do not work and in most instances even if you are going for a build that can work you are reliant on specific units (in my case spice flag and the weaken damage charm I likely could have won without any of the other buffs on Mika but without being able to increase her combo reliably and maintain spice I would have had no win condition viable with what was given to me.) Often you just do not get the pieces you need to make a build work. For example say you get a unit in the shadow tribe that doubles afterburn.

Cool I'll do an afterburn build.

Sometimes you won't get any afterburn applying cards.

2 x 0 = 0

This happens a lot in this game, and there is little means to manage it.

You can win and skill is important there are no per say FREE wins here but sometimes if the game isn't giving you the pieces you need you just kinda lose.

You may think you can reroll or skip cards.

None of that no you get 3 good luck fucker.

There aren't even many chances to take cards in the first place, you get around 6 before the first boss and if you don't have a good basis for your build by the time ya reach the area after that boss you are unlikley to survive.

There are also times the game can feel overwhelming with like up to 10 counters on screen and units to move around. It can often feel like a bunch of spinning plates even with a decent playable build.

In other games you can make a couple mistakes and still one, but in Wildfrost one missed position or one forgotten enemy who attacked one turn sooner than you planned for is a run ender.

The game is more overwhelming and has less wiggle room than anything else.

This isn't without pros it really makes you think which is great but it can be frustrating.

Not to hammer home the comparison but if I misplay once in Slay The Spire I can still recover, there is risk reward and one bad roll on that risk or one unblocked attack is not the end of a run granted it does punish you.

Here that one misplay does end a run and this can be frustrating especially when you simply didn't get the combo pieces you needed.

Some builds I feel are underpowered are sacrifice builds for the shadow tribe and shell/healing builds.

For sacrifice builds you need multiple specific card or a main hero that can summon (which btw heroes are rng so good luck with that) otherwise it doesn't work even when t does it ramps up far to slowly to be useful often needing 2 cards played to do one thing even with some decent synergies.

Healing and shell aka armor don't work cause means to apply healing or armor are to slow and in a game where enemies can in some cases one hit you they are not very helpful.

There are cases they can work but the scaling on them is VERY slow and dependent on getting very particular cards, in addition most healing cards have low max hp so one would assume that you could mix the two to cover that but most shield applying cards deal damage or lower your max hp so that's some pretty hard anti synergy.

How am I gonna use a healer with 4 max hp when most enemies have 6+ attack?

And they heal two?

See above point.

The real issue in my opinion is how punishing the game is compared to others and how dependent you can be on card rng in particular when you have so few chances to try to get other cards every draw really counts.","0.51327437162399292","1681588781","true","457","905","0","10","0","1","0","0"

Difficulty: This is most people's main gripe but if you love a challenge with rogue like deckbuilders, then Wildfrost is excellent. It is harder to begin with than Monster Train or Slay the Spire but this difficulty eases up as you unlock more features. Sadly the features take a while to unlock, but are very easy unlocks that encourage you to try out all styles of play in the game. Once you beat the game (and the first difficulty was easily beatable in 5 or so hours) you can add modifiers to increase the difficulty. Personally, I cannot stand rogue likes that are too easy and make you grind through countless ascension levels just to become a challenge. For me, Wildfrost hit the balance of challenge right, otherwise it simply would not be a good game if you won every time.

Graphic and Design: Impeccable, succinct and streamlined.

Balance: This could do with some shakeups as certain playstyles  do feel imbalanced and easier to get results with. However, the game is well balanced with a ton of variety in enemies.

I highly recommend this to any deckbuilder veterans.

It's really fun but I saw the little developer note and I wanted to give a bit of feedback! Anyways, here it goes:
Now, this game is awesome.
There's a reason of why I did 5,7+ hours on the game when it launched, it's an incredible game and I'll try to explain why here:
Actually, before this big block of text hits you in the face like a building falling on top of you, I'll give brief breakdown of my review.
Art style and soundtrack?
Really good, high quality and soundtrack is top tier.
Gameplay:
Extremely fun and fluid, easy to understand but challenging nonetheless.
Balance:
Well done, Shademancers need a bit of a buff and a lot of heros need a buff (Health buffs, damage buffs and other stuff)
Then, the more 'detailed' review down here:
Art style and soundtrack.
The art style is awesome, props to the artist(s) for giving characters such a charming look just with pixels, the soundtrack is incredible because how well they sound, and then there's the battle musics, they stay chilly at first, but when anything is hit? Boom, the music becomes more energetic and funky, giving adrenaline.
Gameplay:
I love this game not only because of the art style or soundtrack, but because of what makes all games fun: Gameplay. It's really fun and easy to understand, although overburn was a bit more difficult to understand how it worked, you can understand all mechanics quickly, not complicated, but you do need to think in order to have fun and succeed in the game, I made it to the purple ice blocks part and died because I didn't notice something, you have to pay attention in order to win, and the roguelike but-not-so-roguelike aspect of the game is hella fun, although, there's some stuff I have to adress:
Balanced or not?
Well, the game IS pretty well balanced, although I find a LOT of heros to be too weak, the problems are normally their hp, or their counter being too high but their damage/abilty being too weak.
Maybe you see a hero that has a 'lot' of damage (the highest i've seen was around 7-8) , but then you realize they hit every 5 turns and have 6 hp. It's annoying, since it's a glass cannon but sometimes they nerf them even further, sometimes even giving them aimless when they're already weaker than a lot of other heros, I say you can get through a bit of the game with them, but there's something that i'm not sure of, Maybe a lot of heros need to be buffed, or a little amount of them need to be nerfed. Also, for some reason, I find the Shademancers to be the weakest tribe out of the three, not saying they're waay to broken bad, but I seem to get farther in every run with the Snowdwellers and Clunkmasters than with Shademancers, I think they need some sort of buff, what I find weak in them is their heros, when their ability is actually 'Shademancer only' I find them to be weak in hp, damage and their ability lacking too. I feel like JunJun also needs to have a bit more damage (Maybe 3 damage) I don't think I have anything else to say for this game, but it's still a 10/10, I had a lot of fun with the game and I still am, and I hope it stays that way for everyone.","0.523809552192687988","1681587943","true","806","5843","2","11","0","1","0","1"

We just found the randomness of this game is much larger than other games. You know which game I am talking about. Random is not equal to hard difficulty. I am not complaining about anything. I just want to point out several problems this game has and wishes to solve, because the positive of the only English language is nearly 80%, which means this really has some issues besides Chinese players.
1. The 'rebuild leader' problem. The health, attack, and waiting turns of the leader with the same ability and tribe are random. Eg.Health: 8, attack:1, ability: longshot.Health: 8, attack:2, ability: longshot, etc. Even though the numerical system is excellent, I didn't pick the right companion and lost the game. This is a very normal thing. I think almost players have this problem at least once.
2. Only 2 path. Regarding a few events, Players cannot find the right spot to enhance their cards. Also, Players cannot pre-see at least next-boss events to consider their chosen paths. Usually, you don't have coins, but there is a shop and vice versa. I don't think harder difficulty should be described in a random style.
3. Random charm per 50 coins. This is the same problem. If designers wish their game should have challenges, please do not depend on randomness. You will lose a bunch of coins to bet the charm is not shit and is useful to your teams. This does not make sense. I know Charm Merchant can solve it. However, as I mentioned, we don't have a map system to pre-see the events in the next or next-next combat. Players should be luck to do what they want.
4. Boss health and attack problem. I know if you pick the right card, it is easy to make like 50 damages. However, you should care about the unlucky situation. Players cannot kill all bosses when they cannot find the right companion in Frozen Travellers. It is also a luck problem. Why other card games cannot occur the embarrassing issue. They have at least 10 combat and can pick in three every time or 'skip.' The times solve the random problem. However, in this game. give you a example: If you want to pick shroom ability cards to finish stacking 20 shrooms on a single target. You are lucky to 'rebuild' a shrooms ability leader and have met 4 Frozen Travellers from defeating 3 bosses. Oh, nothing is about shrooms, GG XDD.
All in all, The problem is not Chinese players. If designers really change something, we must know your attitude and actual action and change the negative to positive.

With that out of the way, I do have to question what type of audience the Wildfrost devs thought this cutesy 'card battler' game with a deceptively sleek interface would attract. Because Wildfrost is a game that is, down to its bones, rooted in a kind of game design that we don't see an excess of. Much like the winter climes its setting inhabits, and similar to games like Library of Ruina, Rain World, or (dare I say it) Dark Souls, Wildfrost cares not for the player. It places a mountain in front of you, then asks if you can climb it. The game, fundamentally, is about personally triumphing against the odds.

Obviously, this isn't for everyone. But as someone who grew up with flash games like Mud and Blood, The Impossible Game, and countless infuriating point-and-click adventures, Wildfrost...isn't even that bad when it comes to its unfairness. It rewards considered play, smart play, but most importantly, it rewards consistent play. This is a game that demands your full attention at all times, as there are no 'stockpiling' mechanics. You do not have a large but depleting health pool like in Slay the Spire; you are at death's door at every moment. But generally, there will always be a way out (with some exceptions). I understand how this can be frustrating to those coming to this game imagining something more relaxed (a completely fair assumption), but this also drives a constant tension. No matter how good your team, one wrong move and you will be sent back to the start.

Ultimately, I think Wildfrost falls victim not to any particular sin in its gameplay, but in how it presents to consumer expectations. If the aesthetic here was replaced with a grimdark setting and a boxy, uninviting user interface, I'd hazard a guess the ratings would at least be Very Positive. Alas, it inhabits an aesthetic space which its gameplay does not correspond to. 

However, let this not be absolution for all this game's sins, for there are also some game design choices which genuinely seem poorly conceived. In no particular order: the fact that heroes cannot interact with the core evasive mechanic of the game could probably be remedied (perhaps cost a turn to recall your hero, cost another to play them, require them to be played immediately upon draw, and lose if all other units have been killed?); certain mechanics (i'm looking at you bones) have far fewer solutions than others, leading to unavoidable deaths; heroes in general are just a bit problematic in this game (and I suspect for one reason or another some of the design iteration occurred without factoring them in) not just due to their fragility but also their lack of strong synergistic mechanics; and highly varying power levels amongst all aspects of the game, even considering synergies.

Still, these are not game-breaking flaws in the least, and in their own way add a bit of charm to the game (except the heroes being bland as dirt), though I do hope that the developers are willing to take on the advice of the players to some extent when it comes to at least remedying some of the most unavoidable game overs. 

In short, Wildfrost is not for everyone. But if you want a game with serious strategic depth, where optimal lines are often unclear and yet vital to your survival, and unfairness is just another rock to climb, it's certainly worth a purchase.

Addressing many of the negative reviews (its okay to genuinely not like the game of course) which state how absurdly difficult the combat and balancing is:
The the combat plays a bit like Slay the Spire but the few battles and heavy inter/intra-battle decision making is much more akin to something like Monster Train; If you make one or two big mistakes you WILL be punished rather hard. But the opposite is also true. Big combo plays and making an almost degenerative deck can have you crushing through monsters with relative ease.

Yes the game can be brutal. Yes the leaders aren't super consistent with choice at the beginning of the run. Building a deck, deciding if you needs charms or crowns, deciding if your starter cards should be munched....these are all things to consider while looking at your cards special abilities and those of the enemy. So for all those struggling, let me give a few tips that may help you engage with the game a little better, rather than just write it off as 'bad hard game.'

1. If you can safely go for combo kills, do it. That little bit of money adds up, especially if you want to blow it all on the charm vending machine.

2. To meta progress, hit escape at find the achievements menu. Try and clear these to unlock various cards, charms and events.

3. You can and should be moving your cards around in battle as direct responses to the battle situation every single turn. With this in mind, if the battle is almost over, use this chance to recall some of your more damaged companions so they will not incur the 'injury' debuff for next round. Also, your leader always full heals after every battle. Use this knowledge wisely to tank hits. Essentially, you want to be winning each battle as closely as possible to leader death. 

4. Save your charms until right before a battle. You may find another card later on that synergizes with the charm better. Or you may pick a card to work with a powerful charm.

5. READ. THE. DANG. CARDS. Tooltips are there for a reason. Right click on cards to see more stats so you may better plan.

6. Go slow, have fun. No need to rush, take your time and plan out moves.","0","1681582656","true","1123","8953","0","10","0","1","0","0"

Game autosaves after every turn, so you physically can't save scum battles like in Slay the Spire for example. And you usually get severely punished for missplays. 
Sometimes a turn has too much going on and it's hard to plan your next move and easy to make a mistake, but when (if) you figure it out, it really makes you feel smart. 
Haven't noticed any 'unfair RNG' that some reviewers talk about, skill issue in my opinion ;). 
Haven't been able to progress too far yet, so no comments on replayability.
Overall i love the game so far.

If it helps as context, I've put in hundreds of hours into Slay the Spire previously and have cleared A20H on all characters.

I'd describe Wildfrost as challenging, but also extremely fair and rewarding. The difficulty curves does ramp up between floors, but you have many options when it comes to making your team stronger, and careful play of the battles themselves gets you much further than some comments would suggest. 

There are definitely some units and items that are over/under powered that could do with tweaking, but nothing here is game breaking: in games like this, you expect some cards to be easier or harder to execute, and some synergies that seem truly broken if you can only assemble them. But you do have to work with what options are you offered, and try to figure things out from there.

The order in which you play cards in battle matters a lot, you do need to pay attention to the flow of actions in Wildfrost in a way that is likely not immediately intuitive to most players. Once you get a grasp on this though, you'll find that many seemingly unfair mechanics (the aimless pig character comes to mind) have many possible counter play options.

I ended up clearing the game in 10-15 hours (I think, my steam cloud saves have gotten wonky) with all bells and HotS.

Demoed at PAX East, like it a lot, bought it, and it doesn't disappoint. Scratches the same itch for me as Slay the Spire as a deckbuilding roguelike.","0","1681415273","true","442","2123","0","2","250","0","0","0"

Its whimsical art belies a truly challenging rogue-lite card game. I think a lot of the other reviewers may have expected less of a challenge, but this game is not imbalanced! I've made it to the final boss twice in my first few hours playing and I've not unlocked a lot of content. Moreover, when I lose, it's usually because I was careless about some part of how I played the fight. You do need to think carefully before every decision, but that's what makes this game a fun challenge!

The mechanics are done well and the strategy and gameplay are fun. I genuinelly enjoyed so much of this game. There are, however, two issues I have that might prevent you from getting the game. The first is that there is not much variation despite it being a roguelike. There are only two variations of bosses for each level, and the 3 decks you can start with and hold most of the cards you use cannot be edited in any way. This might not seem like much but when the game expects you to play through the runs at least 100 times to unlock everything, you notice. The second issue is that the game is random about what cards it gives you, but there aren't enough to pick from or maybe just enough in general because trying to build to apply a specific status or do a specific thing is almost impossible and many of the quests require you to do so in order to complete them. All together I loved this game, but if you want to get it I would expect a short experience.","0","1681579108","true","1684","4988","53","5","0","0","0","0"

Yes, it is difficult, and as someone who doesn't very themselves as very skilled at these card games, it took me a lot of attempts to beat the game even once. But once I got a hang of all the mechanics, I can see the way I think and plan ahead grow.

The positioning mechanic is honestly genius and makes me feel like a leader commanding my troop's formation in battle in a way that matters. Even though healing is a little hard to come by, the withdraw to heal and cleanse is a brilliant feature. This game really makes you think about risk/reward benefits which makes it all the better when you've planned it all perfectly. 

Some non-boss minions hit hard, yes, but they aren't immortal and I like that you can't disregard the minions in boss fights. It works so well together to make a coherent challenge.

It's very difficult and mistakes are punishing but in my opinion this is a big part of what makes it so addictive!  It's crazy to me that anyone would leave a negative review as clearly a ton of thought and effort went into this game. Aside from a couple bugs I've encountered (mostly related to the smackback mechanic?) it is a great time, and I'm sure even those issues will be ironed out shortly.  Highly recommended!

Unsure why people think this game is too hard.... I was a bit worried after reading some negative reviews, but I bit the bullet and bought it, and the game is fantastic. I'm unsure where people are having issues with winning, as the game feels perfectly challenging.

Yes the game is good
Yes the game is as addictive as StS was (to me at least)
But, if a difficult deckbuilding game is not for you, this might not be the game for you.
Also, so far I don't feel that there are as many unlocks as StS (sorry haven't played other deck building games as much since ^^'), but most games like this get improved with time and many updates.

I won't deny that the game is quite hard (at the moment of the release at least), but not impossible. Thoughout the runs you unlock cards and factions by doing some achievments. Not two games will feel the same as your hero characteristics, starting faction decks are randomized.
I've beaten the game twice for now and I enjoyed my runs a lot. Sometimes you can feel that the run is going nowhere but sometimes you achieve to make something workable and get far. And then you mess up because you didn't use the proper card or forgot the attacks orders or that the enemy unit had some thorns and killed your hero. Classic deck building game experience.

The art is gorgeous, very cute and eye pleasing, the OST by Paul Zimmermann is a real banger (checkout Luminice Dance my favourite). The town is pretty but also pretty useless, you can see most unlocks but there is not choice to make or things to buy, none of that.

About the core gameplay, the game mechanics are very well designed: a hero with stats (health, attack, passives) a starting companion and a bunch of cards with various effects which vary depending on the faction of your hero. The hero's death means game over, if a companion dies don't worry it will only be injured (stats down) until you leave a game without it dying again.
3 factions so far, lots of companions for your faction and some general and cards which will allow different play styles and insures replayability.
 
Yes there is a little issue with balancing, we've said that already, but hey it's a team of 2 people, it's already a miracle the game is this finished and well done (haven't seen a bug so far), give them the time to patch things up it's worth it.

About the future of the game, devs have already said that they are planning to add more content which I will happily welcome. Please support them because this game is great and I'd like to see it grow and shine like StS did.","0","1681567595","true","1617","3774","0","4","0","0","0","0"

I have a LOT of hours into Slay the Spire, Roguebook, and many other card games. It is entirely unbalanced, there's basically no point in withdrawing cards into the pouch to heal them, as there's zero chance you'll still be alive by the time you can use them again.

Your start is entirely random, and you will outright lose almost every game based on the selection of leaders and misc crap you are then given.

In something like Slay the Spire, Roguebook, or Monster Train, if you lose MOST of the time it is due to a misplay, or not following through on a strategy. Occasionally or rarely it is due to bad luck. In this game, there's no way to (consistently) heal your character, and you get one of three choices of leaders, all of which are usually bad in my experience, they either do no damage, have aimless (which will mean when they DO attack they attack at random), or are just mediocre. If your leader dies the run ends. Enemies have very high HP, you will get to pick between 1-2 cards generally between fights, every fight has a boss, and depending on the RNG of what you draw at the start, you can lose pretty much from the get-go.

For example, I get no snowballs (the only way to delay enemy turns), no allies, and am fighting the monkey boss. One of the minor enemy monkeys has 8 hp, attacks every round, and gains 1 damage every round starting from zero. The problem? In my case it takes 4 turns for my character to attack for 4 damage, they have like 9 hp, in that timespan the monkey has hit me for 6 damage, and if I had no attack cards it is only at half hp, while i am down to 3 hp, with no consistent way to heal.

Keep in mind there'll be another like 5 enemies that will spawn in during that time, and on the round I can attack, I'll be attacked by the boss, the monkey that is much stronger than the boss, and all the other misc. enemies.","0.419290393590927124","1681566774","false","162","162","0","119","711","2","1","0"

The art style is beautiful, the soundtrack is so good it distracts me from the gameplay and the game in general is really polished.
All the negative reviews that i've read are about the game being too difficult or having too much RNG, to be honest i think it has just a step learning curve: i've won my first run and for the next 9 hours of gameplay i've lost every single one of them expect the last one where i've finally won again.

I've noticed that the more i play the more i understand how the game works (ye, strange right?) and yes, rarely there are runs where i don't see a winning strategy at all but the majority of my losses are due to my mistakes and not because it's impossible to win.

People complaining about the difficulty are being absurd. It´s what actually makes this game fun! The choices you make, the paths you take, the cards you upgrade, what you play, how you position your troops, it ALL IS VITAL and will change the outcome of your run! 

People want games with meaningful choices and strategy but once they make bad decisions, they call it too difficult. 
80% of my runs have failed because I made a dumb decision and the game punished me for it. This makes it super fun, though. With every run I´ve unlocked new things, keeping the content fresh! And with every dumb choice I make, I learn from my mistakes and get further in the next attempt.

The tribes you can play are incredibly varied and play very differently. 
Heroes, companions, charms and cards with a dozen varying effects make combos and strategies super fun and somewhat unique every run.
The progressive unlocking of cards, charms (card upgrades), companions keeps the incentive to re-run interesting and high.

My only complaint is that some effects are somewhat unclear and require testing to understand. A few of my runs were ruined by this issue. Part of the learning process but it would also just be easier if it was specified how certain effects affect results. Same thing with not being able to see if you´ve reached your companion limit.

Edit:
After having played the game for a longer period and seen all of the different combats and events, I can now say that this is not just an excellent game, it is a fantastic one. I currently always play at 3 difficuly bells, and win between 1/3 and 1/4 games.

Fair warning to everyone: This game is hard, and misplays and mistakes are punished without remorse. You will lose more often than you will win, and you cannot take turns in 1 second like in Slay the Spire or similar deckbuilders.

This game receiving negative reviews because it is perceived as unbalanced and excessively punishing is simply unwarranted, harsh, and a complete misunderstanding as to what the game is trying to be: A slow and pondersome struggle turn by turn, where you simply manage until you succeed.

The game is both hard to understand and hard to master, but is in my opinion in an excellent spot gameplay-loop wise.

If anything, I agree that the introduction has a steep learning curve, an even longer handholding introduction is warranted, information bubbles whenever a new mechanic shows up is imo not necessary but would be a QoL increase for many, and the addition of something like assitance bells for for positive bonuses for the player while learning the game would probably also be a good addition.

This game reminds me a lot of Slay the Spire and The Darkest Dungeon, with how strategic you need to be and with some level of RNG that's involved. However, I will say this game looks and feels quite polished compared to the two, as it feels more fluid. The art style is quite nice to look at and the story/characters you come along as interesting as a whole. However, if I had one thing to say about this game to sum it up, it's that it's very very difficult. It took me a good few hours just to figure out a few mechanics that aren’t told to you, and the learning curve is very steep for new players. I'm not a god at the game but if you take your time to figure out different combinations and paths you can take it's very rewarding. I would say that perhaps it is too harsh for newcomers to this type of game and the beginning can be more forgiving, however other than that I do enjoy this quite a bit, and I do believe everyone should give it a try at least once.

I feel like beating the game is only icing, the real fun is playing through the game and using what you're given and I want to say no, you're not always given the opportunity to win even with the best of skill sometimes but I do want to say most times, winning is definitely within arm's reach. That said, I still do have my gripes about the game:

1.) The starting leaders doesn't seem to make any rhyme or reason to how they are balanced. For example, I can be given a 12hp 5attack 4turn leader and while also simultaneously be given a choice of a 8hp 4nut(shield) 3attack 5turn leader. The second leader is very similar to the first except that it has 2 less attack and has one more turn of count down. Like why? The only explanation I see is that they're from different tribes but the tribal differences isn't THAT big to ever pick the latter leader in this scenario. I can never see a reason why any leader should be 3 attack and have a 5 turn count down - not even if they have frenzy, in fact, 5 count down leaders just shouldn't exist, period. There have been many multiple other instances of just crappy leaders and there's no way to 'reroll' them without starting a run and quitting (which makes me feel dirty).

2.) There are some enemies that are incredibly hard to deal with and more notably, two types of enemies that consistently ends my runs. The enemies I'm talking about is the acorns that gives 3 thorns to all allies and the other acorn that makes all YOUR units aimless. These guys always spawn together and it is completely brutal to have to deal with because the aimless causes you to attack randomly within the row while the thorns is well, going to likely kill your units, especially given how the average hp of units is 5hp, getting just a couple unlucky hits in means everything of yours is dead. Now this wouldn't seem nearly impossible to deal with except that the health of the acorns are like 14hp so not only can you not control which enemies you're hitting in that row but even when you do get lucky, you have to get lucky multiple times. That is just in no way acceptable that these enemies exist with that much health.

All said though, the game is fun, I just don't think playing it with the mindset that you're going to win every run is realistic and quite honestly, that's the way rogue-like games should be. Sometimes you're just given crappy choices and you just have to make the most out of it.","0.751111686229705811","1681558153","true","617","1102","0","6","0","68","0","0"

The art is amazing. The music is exceptionally nice and reactive. The gameplay is highly innovative.

The game is roguelike first and everything second which means you will lose and lose a lot. This does not ponder or feed the questionable mind of 'modern' gamers who cannot stand losing and just scream 'uwah ah oh no I'm 3 hours into the game and I still cannot win the first fight consistently. this is clearly a balance issue.' or 'uwah ah oh no I'm 10 hours win and cannot even get my first win, this is clearly a balance issue.'.
Yes. The game is highly unbalanced, and it is one of the main issue right now but that doesn't justify the amount of negative review the game is getting. The first fight is definitely winnable by any means and there might be some case with cursed bells that will just make you lose but it's just roguelike in general - you are not meant to win every run.

The glaring issue; however, is the bs randomness the game can bring to your run which can be unbearable at times (yes I'm talking about you dangling cursed bells), but if you are playing casually the first few fights are definitely doable and can be won quite consistently (I'm looking at you shademancers).

Another problem is it's a card game that requires skill to play, so it might not pander certain group of people too.

So all in all it's just crying gamers wanting to win everything without caring if they're having fun or not spam their frustration on unjustified 'wah wah unbalanced make me lose 100% fight I cant even do first fight this is clearly balancing issue' negative reviews.

If you don't care losing and just like roguelike in general, the game is for you, but if you are not just stay away. It's just that simple smh.

PS. to dev if they are reading this (though I doubt they will since the amount of comment is aggravating) please recognize how random-ish your game can be and change some achievement required to unlock some amulets. Just make them separate achievement with no unlockables instead.

I see many ppl complaning about balance, some even claming you have to follow some kind of 'meta' to get past the 2 first encounters but thats just not true, the game gives you a stupid amount of free controll during your turn(you can move around your units as mutch as you like, optimizing damage taken you can even for free recall units and they heal up). Like other games the endgame becomes 'scale up FAST' usually but thats not a bad thing, the amount of ways to synergize your cards in this and the interaction between cards are staggering, for example did you know you could use flamewater on cards in your hands instead, for example on slapcrackers(4x random attacks that deal 1dmg) to doubble its damage output instead of putting it on an 6 counter unit. I hate to be this guy but if your complaning that the game is 'unbalanced' or something simular then just git gud and start reading what the enemy cards do.

I dont know where many of these reviews are coming from maybe the beautiful artstyle of the game has attracted many people that never played a rougelite deckbuilder before but the difficulty in this game is not a problem at all. Is the game difficult? yes to some extend since you are required to build working synergies and actively think about your turns. This gets more complicated since the game gives you a lot more options in combat due to how the positioning and effect systems work. This is not a bad thing though and it is precisely because of the options you have paired with the relatively narrow scope of each tribes deck that you have a lot of control about what happens in combat.

Every effect and ability is cleary written on the cards and works pretty much as you would expect. There are some peculiarities that you need to work out when first encountering stuff (for example how the turn order works for cards or that units that consume allied cards will never eat the enemy leader) but after that it is always the same and reliable. I think if you read a card it is very obvious what purpose the card serves and which other cards would have good synergy with it.. Attack buffs are more valuable on multi hit targets / snow can be used to disable certain mechanics etc.

It is still a roguelite though so you will have some runs where you just dont get a working synergy ready in time for the difficulty ramp up. Due to the options the game gives you and the mentioned before relatively narrow scope of each deck these cases are rare though and can often traced back to bad decisions the player makes.

Each Enemy clan/type and boss requires some specific handeling  that you will need to keep in mind throughout the game. Many other rougelites work with optimizing builds for a hyper specific approach which employs the same strategy for every fight and then proceeds to steamroll the game. Such a thing doesnt really work here since you need to keep your approaches rather varied. If you rely completely on one slow heavy hitter you will be fucked by shielded enemies. If you build completely for rapid multi hitters you will be fucked by counter enemies (if you dont circumvent them which the game allows you to do). In short until you have a few runs under your belt and know what to expect you will create builds that have failure points. Again this is normal for this genre and part of the learning process.


The game so far has been awesome and I have had a lot of fun figuring out the best move in any given turn and many seemingly unwinnable battles were clawed back to victory not because I randomly got the RNG god card but because I managed to outplay the enemy setup turn for turn which in my opinion is much more statisfying than randomly pulling  the I win card.

Basically innovating in the Roguelike Deckbuilder genre since Slay the Spire started it.

The visual and sound of the game are incredible. The art for each cards and the designs of characters within the game are so cute and will appeal to everyone. The music when the game is still in its relaxed state, then intensifies in combat and boss battle are amazing. Not to mention how solid the system of the game is, every click on the card or the bell is satisfactory, interacting with map events are great (like crushing the ice to get a companion), equipping charms is always fun, and many fun interactions too. Many can be improve with QoL still, but still solid at launch.

For these alone, this game is already great. But.

Now for the elephant in the room, which the majority have already written. I also agree that the balance of the game is out of whack. It took me 8 hours of gameplay and multiple tries to finally win the game for the first time. I've since started 10+ more runs and yet to reach the final boss again (which is[spoiler] my previous run winner, and I consider that is pretty cool)[/spoiler]. And I just play this genre of game casually.

Now I still do recommend this game for its innovation on the genre and solid system overall, but definitely not for the casuals deckbuilder players. Because compared to other game in its genre, Wildfrost is like Darkest Dungeon in it's early access days. Unbalanced, Stiff (in a way, you can't play your way, you have to play how the game wants you to win), and you are slave to the RNG. You can build your deck to stack one or two effects to make it strong on the first 2 battles, but then you're gonna hit a wall where your deck is useless and you have to restart again and again and again and again.

Now the unbalance does not only applies to the gameplay, but also on how it affects the players. Sure every roguelike/lite games is about making mistakes in your early runs and learn from it so you can make improvements on your next runs. But if the majority of the run you make is a failure to learn from, then the game became a chore, because you have to learn instead of just play.

That's why in Slay the Spire have the option to make the game harder for you with the ascension system, while the basic gameplay is as easy as it comes. It is more accessible and balanced for the players that just wants to play casually and those that wants to tryhard.

That's why in Hades, you can make the game harder with modifier to torture yourself with, while the basic game is a simple hack 'n slash roguelike.

--

I still like this game, and willing to be crushed over and over again since I love playing roguelike/lite games (although StS is only the RL-deckbuilder I've played). But I can't deny the game is unbalanced as I've written, and I hope it can be balanced just like other game in the roguelike/lite genre. More accessible for the casuals and still challenging for the tryhards.","0","1681556073","true","610","11661","93","38","610","0","0","0"

There is basically no difficulty scaling, every fight will be a major challange unless you get lucky with what few new items you get during the run.

You will fight enemies that completely counter your strategy.

The game needs a bit more QoL like too many cards in hand makes selecting the card you want hard, you can't skip adding a card to your deck or an option to confirm where you place a unit before commiting to the turn, but otherwise the game is fully playable.

This game hooked me and 2 other friends for hours on end and took me 10h to get my first win. I genuinely loved the aesthetic and gameplay and kept coming back for more despite my many losses.

That's not the game's fault, that's yours. Wildfrost is REALLY HARD.

Reviewers complaining about 'not enough healing, no mitigation' need to stop thinking this is Slay the Spire where you need to perfectly block on as many turns as possible. All your units making it out with one (1) HP at the end of a fight is Perfect Play (tm). Health is a resource. Use it. Some units arguably work better when coming into the next fight Injured, even. 

This razor's-edge philosophy toward fight balance similarly extends to the progression of an entire run and what you have to keep in mind throughout the run against various enemy gimmicks. The various gimmicks aren't there to be 'unfair and punishing with hard counters', they're there because the Definitely Final Boss utilizes all those exact gimmicks and if you can't pass the midterm exam on each of them, you won't possibly clear the final exam.

The fact that there's a bunch of negative reviews saying they got wiped on the second or even first fight should speak wonders.

Wildfrost has mixed reviews because people bought a game expecting Harvest Moon and got The Dark Souls Of Turn-Based Strategy (tm) instead. Almost every single negative review speaking out against the 'wild imbalance' of the game is speaking from a perspective that has refused to adjust to Wildfrost's expectations of the player, literally playing checkers while Wildfrost is asking them to play chess.

If you're looking for a comfy time, I suggest listening to the excellent OST by it's lonesome while doing something like reading a good book.

Wildfrost is a deep and engaging game that a lot of players seem to be approaching the wrong way.

[b] Forget everything you've come to expect from other Deck Buillders [/b]

Wildfrost leans heavy into the [i] Rogue Like [/i] side of things. Instead of building and perfecting a deck, you get a new hero every run that sort of decides what your build and run is going to end up as. Some heroes maybe  even end up being duds who end your run early, while others will end up synergising an insane deck that completely wrecks your opponents. Depending on which faction you pic, you do get access to cards and support heroes that are constant. As you play, you may get a random hero and immediately know which support cards will go with that particular hero and what you should look out for. And there's a lot to look out for. 

For one thing the game has a number system that counts down on individual cards and when the number reaches zero, those cards carry out their moves. So keeping watch on enemy cards and delaying cards as needed through mechanisms is important. You also need to watch for buffs and debuffs on both your team and the enemy team, and you gotta make sure you sub-out team mates to heal them! In fact, there's a lot going on at any given moment and you really have to play around a bit to pick up on all the games nuances. 

I'm surprised there are so many players calling Wilfrost unbalanced, when they have such little play time. And players saying that the game is 'too hard' and 'unfair' just because they can't kill a boss or two on the first try. Really dude?

This game rewards your time investment. There are unlocks, that help make the runs a little less RNG dependent and there are mechanics to learn that level you up as a player. A sort of meta progression if you will. 

I absolutely love Wildfrost. The art and presentation is stunning, the characters are so well designed and show off so much character for mostly static images and the game as a whole has a charm that makes me want to stay with it. I think it deserves way more than praise than it's getting. (Critically, the game is getting love online, but I think it deserves way more love on Steam)

[b] Once the game clicks, it has that 'one more run' factor. [/b]

I highly recommend Wildfrost, but I implore you to go into it with patience and an open mind.

[i] And devs, I'm all for you guys making tweaks as you feel fit, but please don't dumb down the difficulty or the core mechanics/ vision that you have for Wildfrost. There's a game on here called Souldiers, that a lot of players called out for being too difficult, so the devs for that game caved in and tweaked the difficulty to make it easier. This alienated the players that were actually enjoying the difficulty and now the game sits in Review-limbo. [/i]","0.523809552192687988","1681529351","true","327","1545","0","150","885","1","0","0"

I was surprised to see mixed reviews for this game, so I went back and read through quite a few of them. It seems that the majority of the criticisms are related to the difficulty factor and unbalanced elements of the game.

I must admit that I have lost in this game... a lot! So, is it hard? It certainly can be. But unbalanced? Personally, I don't think so. The unique mechanics and strategies can be challenging at first, but I think it's a good kind of challenge. Every time I lose, I can see what I could have done differently to give myself a better chance, or decisions I could have made to be more survivable.

The game has a unique gameplay setup where you have two rows with three places on each row. You can 'crown' units so that they are available to be played on the first turn. You can also reorder units and recall units to heal them, then replay them later. There are also a variety of cards that synergise with the units. There is so much depth to this game, and it gives you a lot of strategic options to explore.

All in all, the game is very creative and innovative in its mechanics, and I can't wait to play more.","0.531416356563568115","1681551330","true","632","2445","0","10","0","4","0","0"

But the full release game is crippling in difficulty. The first boss you'll face is relatively easy. To give you an idea, you'll have 1 mini boss fight. After that you'll get 2-3 random bonuses you can collect. It may be an extra hero card or it can be a charm to boost a single cards damage. Then you fight the second mini boss. This one is a bit tougher and whatever you've set yourself up for will decide whether you get destroyed quickly. If the 1st fight is a 2/10 for difficulty, I'd say the second one is a 4/10.

After you beat the second boss you'll get another 2-3 bonuses including an option to visit a shop to buy charms or cards with the money you earned on the last 2 fights. What you do at this point is extremely important and if you feel like you've barely made it through the second fight then you might as well just start over because the 3rd fight is easily a 10/10 for difficulty and it's brutal. It's the 'main boss' fight for this chapter of the game. The mechanics and how quickly the enemies advances is nearly impossible if you don't look up a card meta which just always seems silly to me in video games. Like why look up a meta so that I can auto pilot an adventure game just to say I beat it. You might as well hire a robot to beat the game for you. Anyway, I digress.

The issue here is that you've literally only fought 2 battles at this point. Now the 3rd being the main boss fight and only 6 chances to gear up seems pretty crazy considering the boss mechanics. You will fight 1 of 2 main bosses here but they both have a similar second phase mechanic where they either split into 2 smaller version of themselves or they gain 1 attack every single time they hit you. One of the bosses comes out with a hero card with a turn cooldown of 1. So it has a turn every round. Oh yeah, that same card gains 1 attack each turn. So it just snowballs damage. So while you have 3-4 cards on the field, the enemy has all 5. 2 of which are snowballing damage, 1 gives you a debuff that doubles your damage received, and the other does equal damage to its health every 3rd turn which is 6 damage. Most hero cards only have 5-8 health lol.

It's an absolute shit show of a fight and at first I was like 'I enjoy a challenge. I'll start building a deck and creating a cool build to do this fight' and in 5 hours, 25 runs later, I beat it once only to die right after on the second chapter on the first fight.

The boss fights really need nerfed. I think the damages are fine and add a challenging component to deck building but 3 fights? dude. I cant even get out of the first chapter. I'm tired of seeing the snow. Devs. PLEASE. HOW DID THIS EVEN GET BETA TESTED LIKE THIS.","0.495293647050857544","1681550035","false","350","443","0","21","311","2","0","0"

I'm freaking addicted to this.

Alot of reviews seem to focus on how often you would be defeated and how the looping system works with end boss being your prior tribe leader. I love it.
The last time I felt this drawn to a game was Dead Cells and going further back, games like Front Mission and Super Mario.
If you want to play a game that delivers a win to you on a silver platter then yes, perhaps the game is not for you, but if you enjoy slowly figuring out a strategy with what RNG gives you and accepting that RNGesus may not always be on your side, then play this game. 

Retromation on youtube does show a very good approach to this deck builder game. As it is more important to figure out the steps when battling, instead of just creating and wishing for a OP deck.

At a surface level being able to only play one card a turn sounds like a simplification to the deckbuilding genre, but with the character abilities, tactical use of the redraw mechanic and the various status affects the game gains a surprising tactical depth, requiring the player to think multiple turns ahead.  I don't think the challenge of the game is so high as to put most people off, though perhaps those who are expecting a casual playing experience will be surprised by how much the game expects of them.

Wildfrost doesn't have a energy system, instead having a counter + 2 lane grid system for you to play with. Having attacks only happen every 3-4 turns leads to runs that require you to plan ahead possibly up to 10 turns in advance. This, combined with the ally reshuffling and (uncharged) bell redraw mechanics means that this game demands a different kind of strategy from other roguelite games.

You tend to die a lot in the early runs, and I think that's fine. I spent my first 10-15 hours understanding the mechanics and priority order for interactions. Once you've figured out how to exploit the battle system, along with the pool of possible allies/enemies you might face, every run doesn't feel as unwinnable as it once felt.

Perhaps there is validity in the argument of how polarizing each run can be due to the fact that there are less nodes to visit per run, but one thing I've noticed is that you don't really need to 'scale up' heavily to win. Rather, Wildfrost incentivizes having a jack-of-all-trades kind of deck (enabled by its lenient redraw system) for you to draw answers to pretty much every possible board state.

This game isn't like Slay the Spire or Monster Train and that's really refreshing. Wildfrost really plays more like Hearthstone's Freeze Mage in 2014 but without the Frost Novas, Blizzards and Fireballs. It definitely sure is tough, but the win conditions are always in sight (albeit slightly lacking in the final stretch) and the deck can always be improved throughout the run.","0.52173912525177002","1681546623","true","2006","3063","0","6","0","3","0","0"

The soundtrack is incredible, the aesthetics are great, and the metaprogression seems compelling. I am making this review because there are so many people saying the game is too hard and I played it for three hours and I have won a run. Now, it might be a fluke, but I don't think so. The game has a compelling strategic style that rewards thought. I definitely caught some lucky breaks on my won run, but the game didn't roll over and give it to me.

Honestly, it might be that the lighthearted aesthetics of the game (which, again, are incredibly appreciated!) pull in people who aren't familiar with the Slay the Spire-style games, and so aren't used to properly punishing roguelike deckbuilders. To those people, I say stick with it! These games are tough, but rewarding. I remember I had a friend helping me learn Slay the Spire, and I still didn't win a run for weeks!

The runs in this game are shorter than in Slay the Spire, but I'm hoping that the modifiers and clans and pets and daily challenges make for enough variety and difficulty that this has the legs of say, Monster Train or Slay the Spire. Honestly, the runs being shorter make sense --- you don't accrue damage over the course of your run, really, so making the runs longer just gives more time to power up and divides the fun over longer periods of time. The runs are punchy, which is nice, but also leave you wanting just a little more --- building your team carefully, you get something of an emotional attachment to it. My only criticism is that I wish there was some extra challenge boss, how other roguelike deckbuilders do it. But there may be one! That I just haven't unlocked! So take that with a grain of salt.

Hopefully you could tell this from my one criticism being that I wish there was perhaps one more leg of each campaign, but this game is fantastic. I could see myself playing this for a long time.","0","1681542147","true","189","1943","67","7","0","0","0","1"

Difficult turn based strategy games, especially card and board ones, are a secure favorite genre of mine. I completely acknowledge that I could not be any more biased. If you asked me prior to playing this to describe the perfect game to get my attention, I wouldn't have come up with something this good. The visuals and game-play are the strongest delivery to this genre I have seen in some time, it's really something. 

The game is very hard, but the daunting part about the difficulty curve is less the peaks and more the consistent height. It starts quite hard while you get the first couple unlocks, it stays quite hard as you learn the mechanics, and presents new challenges every step after to remain, well, hard. There is very minimal tutorializing, no handicaps for repeat losses, and never a safe encounter. That is probably what caused people to be so thrown off and assume there is some crippling rng problem. It's best to think about it like an old arcade game, once you get the hang of things its very enjoyable but a bit scary at a first glance. 

Skill agency is through the roof, there is an amount of rolling baked in like every entry to this genre but you have so many choices in a turn. Opening hand size is huge making you less draw reliant, enemies broadcast every move they make forever, and every permanent card you place can be shuffled to any space on your board in a turn. Every step has been taken to reward you as much as possible learning. Getting better is extremely achievable should you be willing to invest the time to do it. I thinks its fair to not want to do that, it probably isn't a game for absolutely everyone, especially strategy newcomers.

Personally I think people got into the game assuming it will be very easy due to the ascetics, but that is definately not the mindset you should have when playing this game.

My main gripe is that I wish you had a little more selection with your starting character's traits because as soon as you unlock the other two tribes sometimes youre just stuck with a shitty trait on the tribe you want to play which feels pretty bad.

Honestly i've had no problem with balance, i actually beat the game first try, thought it was just an intro or something but then my team became the new boss.
 Though something new would happen in the campaign, but then after 2 new runs i beat the game again, just to find out my current team would be the new boss, and it would all be the same thing again.
 Then i looked at all the upgrades in the city and feel like they are all pointless, because  i've already beaten the game without them, and they would only  make new bosses stronger. I just miss something like ascension in slay the spire or in monster train, that gradually increase the difficulty, they make you want to keep playing until you get to the final level aka actually win the game, but in this case there is no final level, at least you can't tell,  it just feels like an endless loop. Also, starting the game easy would make the Mickey Mouse casual players happy with their achievement.
I'll keep playing at least to test the new tribes in case there is some end game content, but i don't feel like there is.

I get it the game is hard. İt literally has the 'Hard' tag. What did you expect? A walk in the park type of hard? Well too bad.

This game is one of the best if not the best deckbuilding games with the charm it has. The other deckbuilders made this one look unbeatable but that doesn't mean it is unbeatable. In fact the joy and fun of this game come from this. Why the hell do people play Dark Souls, ULTRAKILL, Elden Ring etc. type of games? They don't complain that it is hard instead they play it because it is hard.

Long story short what I am trying to say is not recommending this game just because It's hard is literally stupid. The only time you should not recommend because of difficulty is when It's actually unbeatable. This game is beatable, most people have beaten it. You, me and most of the people here just suck. But that doesn't mean we should not recommend the game because of something caused by US not the game.

Stop not recommending this game because of the difficulty seriously. I can't even imagine how unmotivating this situation is for the devs. They deserve better than that.

The clans are poorly balanced with some being better than others, especially considering the starter deck (Looking at you Ice Poo clan). Even if you enjoy the mechanics of the Ice Clan heroes, the developers have set up the game to punish players for choosing them at the beginning.

If you like to gamble and like card games, you'll probably still enjoy this. Just don't expect to beat the game by making smart choices mechanically.

I will agree with some of the other reviewers on the biggest thing wrong with this game is the balance. There are some archetypes that just aren't viable and that hurts the replayability because it feels like you either build the same couple runs or lose. However, that will come with time. Slay the Spire, the most famous game in this deck-builder roguelike subgenre, started out similarly and I think people forget that it took years to perfect the balance in that game because it stopped getting balance patches awhile back.

Deckbuilders are challenging, the fun is in making interesting decisions and solving complicated situations. This game is no exception.

This game is oozing with charm, and has cool mechanics that sets it apart from others in the genre. It's fun to play and satisfying to win. 

It's challenging but in an engaging way. You'll have to trust me and many other veterans in the genre saying it's not the game that's unfair, you're just bad. But that's okay! Play more, spend a little more time before clicking on things, learn how different systems interact, and enjoy the process of improving!

It's a unit placement game like Monster Train, but you can dynamically shuffle all of your units between lanes for free, and that plus the turn system makes fights pretty interesting. The fights consist of multiple waves of enemies, with a boss that shows up at the end. You get access to multiple upgrades between fights, such as additional cards, additional companions (units), charms (card upgrades), gold, a shop, and so on. The whole flow of the game (fight battle with waves of enemies, then chose between two upgrade paths) feels a lot like Monster Train, actually. 

If you read some other reviews, it's clear that the biggest point of contention right now is the game's difficulty. This game is not easy. Fights can get tricky, enemies get a bunch of different mechanics to keep you on your toes, and enemy reinforcements can show up and overwhelm you if you don't handle them quickly enough. However, you have a lot of tools at your disposal, the ability to move your units around at will is very strong, and there is actually less rng than in many deckbuilders. Unlike many other games in the genre, you don't redraw a new hand every turn, and instead play one card a turn until you charge up a redraw that you can use when you're ready (or you can use it ahead of time by skipping a turn). Plus, as you progress through a run, you can buy crowns from shops, which are upgrades that let you play the upgraded card for free before the first turn of each fight. With reliable prefight setups and static hands, you can usually plan out multiple turns in advance. I have a good amount of experience in other deckbuilders, and was able to start winning runs right away. I think the complaints that the game is impossible and horribly balanced are really premature, and are likely from people who are either new to the genre or haven't really gotten used to this game's unique mechanics. With all of that said, the game is hard, and the right level of difficulty for any person is subjective, so for some people, this game might be harder than it is fun. 

The presentation, art, and sound are all very polished. There is some meta progression between runs, but so far it has seemed pretty light, and more about unlocking additional options than direct power level upgrades. Runs are not too long (30-45 minutes). It's too soon for me to judge overall run diversity and longevity, but my guess is that it's probably close to Monster Train. Overall, I don't have any real complaints so far.

Normally I don't bother reviewing games, but I think that it's a real shame that this game has been bombed with negative reviews because of the difficulty, so I wanted to share my thoughts.

The difficulty feels it needs to be balanced but I might also just be bad at games. Only quality of life thing as I'm writing this is I feel can be fixed is when you fail a run there is a button that exits to desktop and if playing with controller that's the default option selected. Because of this its way too easy to accidentally close out of the game. It'd be better if the button was for exiting to main menu.

Criticism noted can all be attributed to the game launching two days ago and needs to be minorly balanced. Otherwise it's a fantastic game with amazing gameplay that I cannot recommend enough","0.523809552192687988","1681522768","true","447","748","0","2","0","1","0","0"

It has a really cute art style and tons of charm. There are plenty of fun and workable synergies, and a lot of neat unlocks. I'm writing this review because I really enjoy this game and I'm deeply saddened to see so many negative reviews, especially when I disagree with their theses.

A lot of the negative reviews focus on game balance, and RNG.
To preface, I've played both demo cycles of this game, and have currently won two runs. (9 hrs of playtime)
I think it would definitely be good if some cards got re-balance love, but most cards are very obviously good, or not so good. This is very normal for rogue-like deckbuilders! Some tools are bad, unless you're already severely lacking in them.
This game isn't necessarily easy, despite the art style, and you should not necessarily win every run!

I believe a lot of players are either not thinking through their turns properly, or are not used to the style of gameplay this game revolves around (Each unit has a turn timer until it triggers). The rng in this game is sometimes punishing (as is the nature of rogue-likes), but it never feels unfair. If your deck is based around abusing a single mechanic, prepare to lose if you find yourself against a horde of enemies built to counter it! Building decks with tools to counter your counters is essential.

I think the game could benefit from some ui quality of life changes, (hovering over enemy charms and being able to see their effects, undoing held cards is sometimes finicky), but overall this game is amazing. I highly recommend it.","0","1681522243","true","540","1426","0","4","458","0","0","0"

It shows how fun it is. The game is straightforward with it's mechanics, and the cards are explained really well. There are 3 full unique factions that are easily unlockable right now. The art style and music are wonderful and add to the experience. The charms are my favorite part of the game, they add great synergies and give you the ability to craft unique cards!

Game is challenging enough to feel rewarding to win. And the progression of the game is exciting. Getting to fight against your own squad to win is ridiculous, hilarious, and can be a fun challenge.

Things that could be improved are adding even more variety. If you enjoy the game a lot at the release, some things can get a bit repetitive. But it's understandable at it's current state of the game. Also, I don't really like the pet mechanic (you get a first companion of your choice), because companion choices are very limited. I wish the first companion was also randomized after you choose your leader. Lastly, would be great to see 3 leaders of each faction as a choice. Because once you unlock all the factions, you get a randomized leader per faction, which can be limiting if you really enjoy playing only one of them. I felt much better about it before I unlocked factions, because I could choose 3 different leaders from starting faction. Other than that, it's a great game that I really recommend, and I hope it will only get better. 

This is my first review of the game ever. I can't help but notice lots of negative reviews. I think people forget how challenging roguelites can be. I do see the frustration element where one positioning mistake could quickly end your run.

The roguelike/random aspects can be a little annoying when you're given a bad hand, but the game plays fast enough that it's not a big deal, you just start a new run. And even then, once you learn the basics and take your time to read/inspect cards to understand the various mechanics, you can almost always get at least 3 battles in. I will agree that the game is not user/noob friendly, and it doesn't explain things very well always, so if you struggle scanning the screen for new things and hovering/right clicking to read descriptions, then stay away.

To anyone claiming the first battle is hard often or even sometimes, they either didn't learn the basics, or think the game should let you win if you play anything. The difficulty does ramp up and fully finishing a run is not easy or even common, but in my mind fully finishing a run isn't something that should be easy or common, where's the fun or challenge then?

Please, if you're considering the game, buy it and give it a try, play for an hour or so and get a basic understanding. If you don't like it, refund it, but please don't bash a game for being unbalanced or hard.

Art style is subjective but objectively, a lot of care has gone into their aesthetic.

So far, all the negative reviews I've read are just being salty about struggling at a new game.

That said, it is punishingly difficult, take my reccomendation with that in consideration.
If you don't want to lose 9/10 runs, you probably won't have much fun with this.
If you love a challenge, there's a lot here to enjoy.

[h1]Edit: 10 hours later [/h1]
[b]TL;DR:
I was right, get good or wait for a [i]journalist mode[/i].[/b]

I've 'won' two more runs, at this game's new game+ and new game++ 'difficulty', respectively.
Most importantly, I've learned to respect the combat design in its entirety, every mechanic matters. As an example, the combo kill bonus bling (gold) mechanic which I initially though of as just a bonus. But now I know that focusing on it early can massively offset a normally unlucky run.
Comparing how I felt early on when was struggling, to now, feeling far more comfortable and confident in the game's mechanics, with basically zero 'meta power-progression', I'm genuinely impressed with the mechanical design of Wildfrost.
You can easily lose strong, lucky, runs due to carelessness, and weaker runs can go the distance with enough diligence.

[h1] So, as an edit to my initial review [/h1]
Both art style and game-design are subjective but objectively, a lot of care and effort have gone into their aesthetic, combat design, non-combat encounters and progression.","0.700252890586853027","1681330987","true","154","1920","0","21","634","96","1","1"

You either get the easiest run of your life or a insanely difficult one, nothing in-between.

Each run is very short, it feels like it's missing one or two segment.
I'm a big fan of roguelike, Wildfrost is beautiful but simply feels like an early access.

Hopefully they add content through patches, the game has massive potential.

Update: Some upgrades are complete downgrade with probably very niche application. A Roguelike is about doing the best out of what the game gives you.
But some charms, you simply can't do anything with those without downgrading your deck.
It's especially frustrating when you spend currency.

Leaders needs massive balance, it can go between a massive tank who deals massive damage with cool utility to something that tickles the ennemy, will die at the second strike and offers no bonus.","0.560293138027191162","1681410007","false","235","1491","0","25","0","4","1","0"

The game IS very good:

- nice music
- beautiful art
- good sounddesign
- interesting new mechanics
- different enemies 
- challenging tactical thinking required
- good meta progression
- runs super smooth

The only thing it might need is a price drop of 5 bucks but even at full price its worth it. I don't understand how anyone can give this a bad review. People nowadays instantly whine when they don't win after the first try. Git gud guys and start using your brain.

Is this a difficult game? Yes.

I'm not gonna lie, I struggled a lot to begin with. There are a lot of mechanics to figure out. The UI is easy to read, when you get used to it, but it's easy to overlook things in the beginning, which lead to some... Unexpected and strange run-ending disasters. But once I got more used to the game, once I learned the mechanics better, got used to the fact that I can move things around on the board at will, etc, everything just fell into place.

I'd probably try to look at this game less as a deck builder, and more like a puzzle game. You're not given fine control over what your deck looks like (you can not skip card rewards, and have limited options for removal) and thus you're forced to figure out how to use each piece you're given.

Also having read other reviews for this game about difficulty and balancing I have to mostly disagree. I just reached end credits after 17 hours and 10 runs and I think the game has been balanced really well. Enemies are aggressive and daunting at first but once you start understanding the mechanics and know how to prepare the game begins to feel extremely rewarding. 

I would say certain fights may be less balanced than others and some enemies/mechanics may need to be tuned, overall the game is amazing and worth it if you enjoy tough deck builders :)

Gorgeous art style, super fun concepts, a plethora of combos you can pull off, and great replayability.
The game DOES require a bit of thinking, planning, and adaptability. And it IS difficult. But it's NOT unfair.
The base difficulty (without modification bells) is a joke tbh. Obviously, you can't slap together random cards and expect to win every run, but it's pretty easy once you get the hang of the mechanics. 
With optional added difficulty, as the enemies scale, so do you. The bells give extra money, more card options, and a crown, so you can pull off insane combos. 
Additionally, the devs have already communicated that they'll work on making it more accessible (adding some kind of easy mode I guess, scaling down enemy HP and attack would be my assumption).
There's also the fact that there are so many hidden little interactions for you to discover. For example, one character has a snowball above his head which grows (visually) as his attack increases. 
Absolutely adore this game, and would recommend it to anyone who likes roguelikes and deck builders. 

TL;DR The game is difficult, but not unfair. Devs are already looking into adding some kind of mode with lower difficulty for all the wimps out there. If you can actually read the cards and don't mind being challenged, the game is actually a MUST-PLAY for all roguelike/deckbuilding fans.","0","1681505549","true","1404","8645","0","5","0","0","0","0"

I think understanding a few general strategies (which in my case were obvious since I came from Inscryption Kaycees mod, which can also be brutally unforgiving in the higher levels, as one bad play can kill your run and uses some of the very same techniques of withholding your own characters powers when necessary) can really improve your user experience with this game, so I will give some detail regarding this below.

General strategies: You have to approach this game like a high stakes puzzle game. It is not simply wise to attack with everything whenever possible. I think many people make the missassumption damage = good and therefore do not pull back characters into their deck when they would hit something that has a terrible trigger effect when approached. Often it is not even wise to pull back characters from the field entirely and simply getting them out of the wrong lane can help, as then their turn timer will continue ticking down. This doesn't mean however that one should not try to get good damage in whenever possible, as certain enemies must simply be taken out immediately.

Abuse the absolute hell out of abilities, I mean it. Choose a type of synergy and stick with it, there are most often ways to break the game, even when your draws haven't been super amazing. Keep your deck as trim as necessary and do not overload on allies.

One of the largest parts of the game is knowing how to prioritize properly. You basically need to create a strict hierarchy of  which actions to undertake, how to stack your field, as well as which enemies to apply to with which cards when. If a turn takes 5 min, it takes 5 min. I watched RTgame play this game and he had a couple of serious misplays because he was interacting with the stream as an entertainer more than focussing on the game (which I absolutely get if you're a streamer), but this may generate a lot of frustration when approaching this game from the wrong angle. When do you reroll your hand? What is in your deck? Which enemy do you attack with which effect? The game in this sense is more like a chess game than something you can just casually wing, which is where I think a lot of the frustration for players comes from. If you do not enjoy chess (in this case mixed with some draw probability), you will not enjoy this game. I think some of the aesthetics of the game give off this vibe of a general RPG game, which makes people fall into long formed habits when approaching their playstyle whereas it should be approached more like a puzzle rather than a 'turn based RPG'. In turn based RPGs it is generally not necessary to hold or pull back characters, or apply some other weird mechanics like in this game.

Always bring freeze: to stack freeze and mushroom to make enemy characters fail their special reactions and get high damage in is absolutely crucial, as well as keeping your deck trim to always draw well. Abuse the absolute hell out of things like the sunshine rod or whatever it was called that ticks down your characters timers more quickly and stack characters with broken effects. Basically think: How can I play this the most unfair way possible, always freeze everyone, create broken playstyles and keep your chessboard tactics going.

To some degree I agree with the many criticisms, there could be a few RNG fixes here and there and maybe a slightly more beginner friendly intro/playstyle for people who aren't yet suited to high stakes card games where every turn counts, but overall I think I get the devs, I just think they need to improve User Experience by communicating better.","0","1681504596","true","117","1164","0","1","0","0","0","0"

But outside of the nightmare that is a 7/15 Aimless Wild Board or 'Your Team has Aimless and We all have spikes' Cats I think the only real issues with the game are that there need to be more than 3 difficulty modifiers, spikes need a counterplay mechanic outside of 'deal 60 damage with spellcards', and the charm-enemies difficulty bell needs an overhaul. Some charm-enemy combinations are just plain game-ending and nothing feels worse than losing a expertly crafted run due to RNG

I still think this is an incredible game with so much potential and though it is definitely hard and frustrating at times This can easily become my favorite deckbuilder with a little tuning.","0.501354992389678955","1681502512","true","1142","9475","0","12","0","1","0","1"

Love the art style, love the general vibe of the game, love the gameplay. As for what seems to have become the elephant in the room, the challenge level, it's certainly made me think, but I haven't had anywhere near the negative experience that a lot of others seem to have. I've won several times and gotten the true ending (at least what seems to be the true ending) and I haven't run into anything that seemed insurmountable along the way. I do have a lot of experience with Slay the Spire, Monster Train, and such going in (as well as Dungeon Beneath, which has positioning mechanics a lot like this game) so maybe that's the difference, but on the whole I've found it a fun but not at all overwhelming challenge.

Also, there have been a lot of roguelikes recently that have 3+ hours runs; while they can be fun, this game sits at a much more enjoyable ~hour per run, which I really appreciate.","0","1681481819","true","797","5324","130","3","269","1","0","0"

First off I want to adress the elephant in the room: Yes, the game has a relatively high skill floor ergo going into this game you will fail a lot to little mistakes. BUT you will learn of them and become better quickly and I wouldn't say the game is more difficult than Slay the Spire just a bit more complex as you have to juggle characters and their cooldowns. This game is a little like a puzzle, maybe comparable to Into the Breach, and when you like more in-depth tactical gameplay, this will hit the spot! I am a total noob gamer, play everything at Normal, mostly even on Easy difficulty. I don't have any prowess in tactical RPGs.

I still won my first run after 5-6 hours. 5-6 hours I spent being frustrated from time to time, but also being entertained A LOT! I haven't felt this kind of wonder since Slay the Spire. I took breaks in between and came back stronger. I won my 2nd run after round about 16 hours this time even on the higher difficulty which is unlocked after the first win, again having a lot of fun learning all the mechanics, the bosses, the enemies and their moves. Remember: I AM A CASUAL GAMER. And I still made it. So you can do it, when these games are up your alley and you love intense tactical RPG card combat systems. The battles are intense, but also highly fun.

The game scratches the Slay the Spire itch SO MUCH. There are a lot of card battler rogue lites nowadays and none other than Wildfrost and Slay the Spire hit the spot for me as perfectly as they did, even though I did try a lot of them. But Wildfrost also does apply its own spin on these with a lot of tactical depth, charming characters and soooo many mechanics that can mix and match perfectly. Yes, you can go for a build that focuses mainly on one mechanic. But I tried that a lot of times and I was actually more successfull with builds that featured 2-3 or even more mechanics.

The only point I love to loathe about the game: You are highly dependent on RNG. Sometimes I will end up with a useless leader. Or a leader that has no synergy with the first 1-2 travelers I meet. Which make the early stages especially hard to get a decent run going. This can be viewed as a plus point, because you are forced to go out of your comfort zone and have to try out builds, you never thought to try, but also being forced can feel restricting and mean. I don't mind it too much, so it is no dealbreaker for me.

Also the meta progression feels sometimes a little punishing, because some unlockables aren't really that good. It would be nice if there would be a menu to turn specific unlockables off, because they water down the pool of available cards and as the game is pretty dependent on RNG as it is, it makes you having the build you want even harder to pull off.

All in all I love this game. I already played it a lot these past few days. I loved the Demo on the Switch, I purchased it on both, Steam and Switch and use those games together with my partner and we are both having a blast playing Wildfrost. ♥","0.566787004470825195","1681499321","true","982","1667","0","4","0","18","1","0"

The difficulty. I expected something very bad. But what I found was after a few games of learning how Wildfrost works I found the game isn't all that difficult. People said it has a long unlock curve but compared to a game like Across the Obelisk that's not true.

The game requires you to learn how Wildfrost plays differently from other games to learn the gameplay loop. Games are quick. Bad luck can happen with card/ally selections. But this means that you spend 15minutes and restart which isn't bad.

I worry about the game getting too easy based on what the primary amount of users seem to want it to be. But if you're playing the game now, stick with it. Learn how the gameplay works. Unlock some more things and stick with it.","0","1681499040","true","381","852","0","28","693","0","0","0"

In fact, I think it's a fantastic. I've played my fair share of rogue-like deck-builders like Slay the Spire, Monster Train, and Dicey Dungeons and I believe that in many regards Wildfrost is at least on par with them in most ways. If you want to save some time looking through reviews I'll say this: If you like the games previously mentioned, and are willing to loose most of your runs (at least at the start) and are down for a challenging experience that rewards you for game knowledge and perseverance with unique mechanics and a style and direction wholly unique for the genre then pick it up. It's obviously not perfect. The reason why this game has a mixed reviews (as of now) is because people believe that the game is so atrociously balanced that's its almost unplayable. I will be the first to admit that the balancing needs some work. Sometimes your starting heroes are so bad that you might as well throw in the towel in your first combat. Sometimes you'll enter a combat where, if you happen to draw a bad opening hand you might just loose (I'm looking at you early poison).
There's also the teeth cave. 
I do not like the teeth cave.
There is more, but to go as far as to say it is unplayable is just not true. And it becomes easier as you keep playing and you learn what works and what doesn't, when you unlock new cards, and you know what to look out for. Wildfrost is a great game that may or may not require some patience and some tweaking (which the devs have already admitted in a recent post) but it is a shame that a game this fun with a incredible style that completely contradicts it's difficultly is sitting at (as of now) 60% positive reviews, which obviously is really bad for a rep of a game that just came out. I just hope that people who like the game find it and maybe can help stabilize that score. 
Also, pro tip, pick Blunky every time you see him, trust me he is for sure the strongest companion in the game.","0","1681494597","true","1160","2593","0","6","0","0","0","1"

I have been loving when things go right and i can make combo decks i love but i'm writing this review mostly to complain about a few things that are very annoying and make the game feel like the highs are highs but the lows are very low.
So do i recommend the game? [b]Definitely![/b]
But a few of my problems with it and i hope the devs adress in the future are

1- [b] Give me a quick reset button please. [/b] Or at least let me pick the one leader between all of them not just 3. Is ok to try to force the player a bit to experiment new things but i think that is a very hard task to do in deck builder games. Sometimes i don't want to have an aimless leader, nor want one with extra junk buff but i'm also tired of doing frenzy. Let me pick the achtype i wanna play at least if the cards that gonna build it will be random after.

2- [b] So far the unlockable companions seems very bad. [/b] I unlocked 4 so far but they all don't seem to add much to their archetypes, I might don't see their potential yet but in my runs i always find more use on the basic ones than the unlocked ones. Give them a little buff, they are achievements after all.

3- [b] Loki's collar bell should jiggle when he moves/attack. [/b] This one is very necessary.

4- [b] Explain specific interactions. [/b] Many you can experiment and learn but when you lose a good rng run bc you didn't know how something worked is very frustrating. RIP my 2 runs i lost bc counter attack triggers on the attacking unit only if it is in the same row of the defender. It is an interaction I had no way to know it worked like that and costed my runs against the tiger a few times.

5- [b] For real it would be so cute if Loki's bell would jiggle when he moves. [/b] Think about it.......

Few things are holding this game back from its full potential, and i would say i'm not completely against the idea of rng cards, but compared to other deck builders i wish we could have a bit more of control over what our deck gonna be. Leader is random, companions are randoms (besides pets), charms are randoms, make it so hard to have fun doing a massive bunny bomb deck for example.

Game-play 9/10 The game itself plays very well and all the mechanics feel very unique and good to use with only a few feeling stronger then the rest and one or two they don't feel very impactful or weak.

Difficulty 5/10 The first few runs felt very friendly and the losses felt fair and it wasn't too hard, but as you progress and play through the difficulties it starts harder to win each time with each run be a challenge from start to finish, with the end being very tough and taking awhile to get through.

Replayability 7/10 - Each run always feel a bit different from the last. Each hero has different traits and with the ability to choose your starting ally. However they always feel too short and there aren't a lot of options if your going to bet the true final boss, and after several runs i wish the rest of the game was longer or had more choices to choose from 

Overall - 7.75/10

Final Thoughts - I feel the game is very charming, feels fun to play, and has very cool mechanics but it lacks something to make the runs more enjoyable and last a little longer and the difficulty gets very hard very fast. However i still enjoy the game and don't mind the extra challenge.

The game is really polished compared to most releases these days, it has its own unique art style which is actually pretty great. The game is challenging and fun and the repetitive nature is curbed in a lot of ways. The dailies are great, the hero/item mixes keep it fresh. After 30+ hours I'm constantly kicking myself for forgetting how things will play out and losing for being dumb then immediately throwing another run together.

My critiques would be that it can be a bit repetitive despite all the combinations possible. In each run you are essentially doing the same thing over and over. A pro and a con is that your successful run becomes your opponent (on crack) next run. This is good because it teaches you how to counter certain strategies, ex smackback with freezing, buuuut it also motivates you to not make your heroes too good either which is a bit counter to the purpose of a game like this IMO.

If the developer is planning to continue to add to the game I think there is plenty of opportunity to expand on the game and help the critiques I've seen of price and repetitiveness. Having another adventure level to finish after the first (rather than ending your run) for example. Having a crafting service in town where you could spend unspent bling upgrading cards or something would be a way you could progress across runs. I'd like to see some more depth if an expansion/DLC is added. Another way to add depth would be more opponent types/base card deck combos. Maybe another epic daily of some sort or a pve tournament you could use saved up blings to enter and gain special crafting mats or blings from doing well in.

I received this game for free, however, for transparency I typically rank games on pricing as 'good' at $1/hr of entertainment and 'great' at $0.50/hr from a pricing standpoint.

A good chunk of cards are useless because they either have a random chance to kill your hero or give the enemies strong buffs. 

Progression looks cool but half the time you are unlocking filler that doesnt actually improve card choice. 

You have to kinda just hope on a good build to happen.

There isnt much choice you can do when all you are offered are 0 attack units.

but holy mother is the actual game so disgustingly balanced, enemies can and will just completely wipe your board at the slightest of whims and if you dont have perfect luck your hero will just get steam rolled and end your run

the entire combat revolves around a counter that every individual has and every action you take (save for a few exceptions) makes it count down so that they can do their action, this is fine, but its extremely frustrating when your own counters are averaging 4-5 turns and the enemies are 2-3. to add to the frustration, your hero (the character that you play as and if it dies your run ends) often times has single digit HP and rarely do you have a way to heal them, so any damage they take is often deadly or borderline maiming, so if you dont have a wall of companions to hide behind you will feel heavily oppressed. and often times hiding behind a wall doesnt even work as enemies with aimless (which is supposed to be a 'random target') will most likely just target your hero down or your main carry (which is just a fancy way to say dead run)

its like fighting a trained military of super soldiers with your backyard 2x4 (gnomes take this literally)

with that said i will keep playing this game because its very fun and addicting but right now, its just not recommendable. It has a lot of potential though.","0.477372884750366211","1681490579","false","1074","4741","61","1","0","5","3","2"

Yes the game is difficult but it gets easier the more you play, like any rougelite. You unlock more times, characters, mechanics, and more as you play. Every loss I’ve had as been preventable. I simply wasn’t paying attention, poorly planned for the “final” boss, ect. 

The last boss fight is a really unique system that I think is an awesome mechanic. It requires you to think and plan for it while also having to survive on the way.

As someone who isn't experienced in this genre, it's VERY easy to get into and learn without feeling like I'm being patronized with 'easy' instructions. The journal we get is well-laid out, the descriptions on the cards make sense, and the mechanics (like the charms) are intuitive. With all that comes a good challenge! It took me a lot of tries to beat the demo, but I never got upset with the different attempts or (as appears to be the case to a number of negative reviews) felt like it was 'too difficult' or 'ramped up too quickly.'

I've played around 60 runs at this point and I'm hoping to have the opportunity to get into some other exciting builds that I've only gotten a taste of. Coming from StS and Pirate Outlaws, I'd agree with others that the game is probably not as balanced as it could be, but for less than a week in, I'm more than impressed by everything there is to offer. To put the balancing into perspective/reliance on RNG, out of my 60 runs, I've one once and gotten to the final boss 4-5 times. Some of that is certaintly learning curve and getting a feel for the game, but there is a strong sense that you are reliant on getting just the right combo of items, companions, and cards to get something powerful enough to have a chance at the later stages.

Some thoughts on balance, within each tribe there are several 'routes' that I get a sense you could win with. I think there need to be a couple more companions/items in each of those to make sure your deck is no reliant on gettin 4 out of the 5 cards that may have a chance at working. Additionally, some mechanic that offered a bit more choice in the cards you picked, enabling you to better guide your deck in the right direction. I think part of whats punishing about the existing system is that you have limited companions, items, and opportunities to put charms on things, and ideally by the 1st boss you'd like to have at least 1-2 cards to invest your charms into. This makes picking 'duds' (whether that be an item, companion, or charm) really painful as you have a useless card in deck, and you don't want to waste charms on making it worthwhile.

I'd also agree with the critique that there are certain leaders that you just don't want to give a try to. With the leader being your first card and your only required card, it sucks not being excited about yours during a run.

Hopefully these thoughts can be helpful! I'd still say I have loved the game, will continue to play it fervrently, and look forward to balancing updates (and hopefully DLC too!)! (Also would love a mac version :D)","0.504854321479797363","1681446886","true","1366","3069","0","3","0","2","0","0"

 - There is not much to unlock for now, so you can expect a short game but with replayability (there are some daily challenges, and 3 different trybes to play, which allows changes into the gameplay)

 - The balancing is not right yet, the difficulty curve is too big and it is not fun to have your run ruined because of RNG

My review is an edit because I did not recommend this game before, I am changing the review simply because even after being beaten the shit out of the game, I kept coming back for more, so even if the balancing is not on point for now, the game is still fun.

if I had to say a suggestion, what I felt was missing the most is the option to reroll the store, the treasures or the frozen allies to try to go for a specific build and the option to skip the treasures in exchange for blings.

And finally, what the other comment said about being able to see what will happen in the turn as in monster train sounds necessary for a game with so many units on the screen, it can help many people with the difficulty and it would let me relax a bit while I play (in my opinion the difficulty is ok but some builds are harder to succeed than others).

Combat is highly strategic. There are broad strokes of Monster Train in the experience, but WF's countdown system is novel and very satisfying to navigate. Each fight is an elaborate puzzle, and the game gives you exactly what you need to overcome it, if you can find the line.

There's lots to unlock (although I am finding it a bit hard to 'focus down' certain achievements intentionally, so I may have to just wait for the right chance to come along), and seeing the town of Snowdwell grow is a cozy visual delight, much like everything else the game.

I got about 11 game hours out of it the first day, and that has more then justified the $20 price tag.  Still working on meta progression (lots of ?? left) and haven't even dug into the daily challenges yet.  Beat the game once, and missed a lethal on the final boss a second time.  Some other strong potential winner runs I have lost part way to carelessness, it's dangerous to try to move too fast in this game due to how low health your Leader can be.

Gripes:

1. Even if you kill the boss of a stage, a lot of extra damage still gets tossed out.  This is so you can clear the extra enemies for combo bonuses, but if you're not clever can also kill your leader after 'winning' a stage.  Lost a strong run to not paying attention to after seeing lethal, and the extra damage hit a Smackback that killed my leader.

2. The way they handle updating the last boss after the first kill can also be frustrating, but also pushes me to making smarter choices and trying out new builds.

3. One level specifically unbalanced and is a run killer if I don't have an exceptional team by that point.  The monster that eats other enemies and stacks their stats, who starts one the board with 25 hp and freeze resistance, is almost impossible to beat on a weaker run.  Sometimes I don't get that encounter at all though, and almost always can beat the other option for that area.

A lot of these negative reviews read as mad cause bad to me.  One said they died on the first battle / boss multiple times in 20 runs in 3 hours?  I've played for 11 hours, am only at like 15 runs, and very rarely die on the first battle / boss, even with all the different builds/leaders I've tried (which they encourage through meta progression quests).

However, do remember by purchasing you're directly supporting Chucklefish, who are an exploitative and abusive company.

What's wrong with the gameplay? I'm an A20H Slay the Spire player, and because I was expecting this to be a contender to StS, I'm going to judge it relative to that. If you're not looking for a StS-like experience, then take the below with a grain of salt. I also only played for 2 hours, so I can't comment on how the game changes as you unlock more items.

In general, the most disappointing part of the experience was the lack of agency. I felt that playing only one card per turn significantly reduced the sense of control, despite turns being more numerous and shorter than StS. Being able to also move units does not add much to the decision space, as it's usually obvious what the best positioning is.

Outside of combat, the pathing options are reduced (Monster Train style), and there is a complete lack of events - your choice are usually card removal, gold, a shop, a card or a charm.  

From the few relics I saw, these appear to be far less interesting than other deckbuilders. The only relics I saw in my gametime affected card draw/other uninteresting things. There are also no card upgrades, but you can add effects to cards using charms.

All of this made me question the long term replayability of the game, as there simply isn't enough variation in the gameplay, or enough interesting decisions to make, for me to see myself putting even 50+ hours into this. Not to mention the lack of ascensions, beyond what I hear is simply adding random charms to enemies, which is a very lazy way to scale difficulty.

And finally, be warned that the game *is* reasonably difficult, but I did beat the first two bosses within my 2hr playtime. The difficulty of the game is a really weird design choice, as the lack of agency (and the cute artwork) really make you expect to be able to breeze through, and that's clear from the negative reviews the game is getting. This game really needs to decide who its core audience is, because right now it's appealing to neither the die-hard deckbuilder fans nor the casual players.

I think if the enemies were a little less responsive so quickly or reinforcement counter was like a turn longer it might flesh it out more.

Just my opinion. For the hero you start with, maybe add a little more pizzazz to them like with hero options:
--
Better stat hero
--
Hard focus strategy hero
--
more than one status effect

Around those options only because, starting with a 3 health range hero with long shot feels pretty bad when your random companion rng isn't a tank.

I see a lot of reviews mentioning balance issues, but so far I haven't run into any balance/difficulty issues that weren't my own fault (bad card selection, bad plays, etc.). I do think the round difficulty scales faster in Wildfrost as opposed to other deck building games, but so does your own strength. This does mean that choosing a bad card can be fatal, but at least for me, deck synergies have been easy to pick up on early so I know a good direction to take my deck building.
Similarly, being able to change my cards location on the field for free in-between rounds is a fun mechanic that allows for unique strategies, but is also punishing if you blunder.

Overall I enjoy the game and am satisfied with my purchase.

Slay the Spire, Dicey Dungeons, etc, they're fantastic, but bad luck can be extremely frustrating.

I'm not having this problem with Wildfrost.

Now obviously I've only played an hour so far, and I definitely haven't made much progress, but every time I've died so far, I've always felt like it's my fault in some way, whether I made a stupid decision or didn't prepare well, and even in the times when RNG has screwed me via lacking options for card synergy or in-battle junk, it still feels so much less frustrating than in other roguelike deckbuilders. I think this is partially because of the way the gameplay is structured; there's no obvious endpoint, just a continuing path, and you're not spammed with cards or the like. Every encounter keeps you incredibly invested with how you're strategizing, and even when you lose, the progression with the town can help you still feel as though you're making progress.

If you really want to try this game but aren't entirely sure, I'd say go for it. I'm having a blast so far and the literal only reason I'm taking a break after an hour is because I, unfortunately, have important things to do T_T But I will absolutely be back ASAP to see more of this game. I only hope I can actually strategize well enough to do well, hah.

EDIT: So. I've played this a LOT more. Like 16 more hours. And I did beat a run in that time! Then proceeded to LOSE MY MIND. I won't say why, you need to see it for yourself, but trust me when I say that the game mechanic twist after you beat a run the first time is WILD and I love it so, so much. I have yet to beat a second run, but fingers crossed.","0.519615650177001953","1681307857","true","91","11253","0","12","0","1","0","0"

Now the RNG and difficult fights, the #1 complaint of this game, they are heavily RNG dependent with your starting cards, but do a few runs and get better starting cards, I assure you, you'll get past the first fight no problem. Next up is synergies, and just because one card does something with health in it's description, doesn't mean that another card with health in it's description will synergize well.

All that being said, you have to play it to get good at it, and you have to play it to see the interesting cards and conditions.

You're unable to decline picking a card which has bad implications for deckbuilding.

The game itself is an Excellent rougelike deck builder, very unique compared to the other big ones on the market. Much harder than many I've played too, which is great. 

Many of the complaints from other reviews come from not realizing that the game play is a lot more like a puzzle with a lot of moving pieces you have to solve from turn to turn, rather than more straight forward damage calculations (although those are there too). The game demands a lot more precision each turn than most other deck builders, (even Spire until you hit higher ascension levels).

You can definitely brute force some very strong combos, but the game puts a big premium on planning ahead for specific threats, and you wont get good at that until youve lost a good few runs.

Another thing I've noticed after several dozen runs is that while leaders feel weak, I've actually been getting more robust and useful ones now that I've unlocked a good bit of the meta progression. I don't know of they're set to scale up based on your unlocks or if I'm just getting more comfortable with the game so I see the value in things I dismissed before. (I suspect its a bit of both.

Lastly, some things definitely are over or under tuned. Bigfoots are pretty insane and demand an immediate answer. A few player cards could probably stand to have their numbers bumped. One thing I'd really like to see is more cards that don't use up your turn. Not too many, one to three at most. The flow of the turns is really strong as it is, but I think being able to play more than one card per turn almost doubles the decision space that turn, which is really interesting if its not every turn.","0.502262413501739502","1681474320","true","612","2810","0","11","271","1","0","0"

Period. I think that there are legitimate criticisms to be made with the game, but my god. As of writing this review the game is sitting at a 60% review score and that is just simply unfair. One of the top reviews as my writing this complains that they died multiple times in the first fight in the run and that they had 20 runs in 3 hours. Having played around 5 hours myself, and having no prior experience with deckbuilders in the past, I can honestly say I have no fucking clue how that dude managed to lose the first fight enough times that they felt it necessary to note it in their review. 

The game is challenging. It is, sometimes frustrating, but I can honestly say that most of my deaths have been because I made a mistake, and I was playing too fast. Some reviews are complaining about needing some crazy luck or needing a perfect build, and that is just not at all true. I think maybe one of my runs was extremely lucky, and it wasn't the run that made it to the end. With smart play, making the most of your resources, and attention, you can make the most out of the vast majority of your runs. I can not emphasize enough that the reviews blasting the game about horrific balance and extreme difficulty are likely playing too quickly, just generally, but certainly in battles (once again, as a complete newcomer to the genre, no clue how one would manage 20 runs in 3 hours). And to say that the different enemy types require an exact 'answer' is just flat out wrong. A wide array of strategies are entirely viable, and I've had great success with several, frankly entirely unoptimized builds. The game requires careful thought and each decision. It isn't 'impossibly difficult,' it just requires patience and for you to not rush through every turn. I don't mean to outright attack other reviewers, but I worry the review score will drive away prospective new players. Most of the negative reviews are severely misguided, and clearly aren't engaging in good faith with the mechanics the game provides.

I can't say it is perfect, but I can say I've had a great amount of fun with it, and the current review score is criminal. It could absolutely do with some tuning, I can't disagree there, there are certainly some cards that just feel worthless, but to say that the majority are unusable is laughable. There is a legitimate criticism to be made in the games draw system, as it at no point informs you that you will be able plan out your future hands by looking at your deck and your discard pile. This is an extremely important mechanic, as it eliminates a rather large random element, and I only discovered it on accident.

The design, both visual and sound, are delightful, and full of little touches that show that the devs clearly had a great deal of passion for this game, and a great deal of enjoyment for it. Please, please don't be swayed by some of the less charitable reviews. The game is more than worth your time, and I don't regret my purchase for a second. I rarely if ever write reviews, but I felt I had to for this game. If I had to give a rating, it would be sitting much close to 85%. There are legitimate criticisms to be made with this, in terms of some design aspects and balance, but it's hard to have that discussion when the majority of the negative reviews I've seen have been made seemingly in bad faith by people that grew frustrated with a game that demanded their attention.

This game is not 'impossibly hard.' This game is not 'all rng.' It requires time, attention, and a great deal of player input for every decision. Saying that there is very little the player can influence or do is a flat out lie. I have saved what seemed like unwinable positions and lost what seemed like a sure thing, entirely on my own competence.

First off, the visuals and the music are absolutely top notch. To the point of sometimes distracting you form the actual gameplay to just appreciate them. The tactical nature of the combat with the positioning of your units feels very rewarding when you begin to understand it.

I really wanted to hate this game but I just can't. It had so much potential but failed to waste any of it.

First of all I really wasn't looking forward to playing it. Alas, it went straight to the menu without an error message. I tried corrupting the file integrity, downgrading my graphics drivers and uninstalling Windows updates but to no avail.
And before you say it's my computer, none of my other games run without problems.

Next, the controls are not rebindable, which is a HUGE non-issue because you have only two buttons and they picked the most intuitive ones like A for accept and B for back. I had to use a 3rd party program and play with my elbows to get any feeling of clunkiness. Absolutely not unacceptable and I expected less from a small indie dev in 2023.

The game's difficulty is total bullsh*t. Yes, the RNG can be overcome with strategy and good decision making. Yes, you can do so every time, but I beat Dark Souls, which means that I'm a really good player and losing can't possibly be my fault. And I'm not alone with this opinion; just look at all the negative reviews.

Lastly, the devs aren't anything phobic, nor are they woke, so you don't even know if you own the left or the right by buying this game. Maybe none of them! Ugh! I wish indie devs would stop making everything about gameplay and focus more on politics.

Overall I wouldn't recommend this game at 90% off. Not even 50%. Wait for at least 10% or buy it at full price, otherwise you're gonna regret it later on and feel like a filthy thief forever.","0","1681461699","true","766","3147","0","16","439","3","3","0"

over all its not as bad as most negitive reviews make it out to be, but I would steer clear until the first QoL patch","0.47826087474822998","1681371921","false","403","917","0","65","670","0","0","0"

This game is beautiful, challenging and addictive. The soundtrack and the art alone are worth every penny, but combine it with fantastic gameplay and you'll have an amazing game.

The meta-progression is very well implemented and allows you to push further and further every single run, You will get crushed by new foes over and over again until you adapt. But not at any point frustration will kick in. Every run allows you to play a completely different style and with the different tribes you'll have even more variety.

Every single encounter could end your run, leaving you on the edge, while your cute creatures fight other more angry cute creatures. 

If you like Monster Train or Banners of Ruin, this game will totally be up your alley. If you like cute things and banger soundtracks, you should also give it a go.

Now I will say the game isn't ridiculously hard as it sounded like it would be, but there is a lot going on and if you miss an effect that an enemy has or misalign your characters, it could result in a bit of a mess or injuries to a character or two!

But the fact that one of the more popular reviews states that they had 20 runs in 3 hours, and had somehow managed to die in the first battle is shocking! In my 3 hours I had 4 solid runs and made it to the third zone, with each run being a different unique setup than the last. I made a mistake or two in a couple runs which didn't ultimately end them and still did alright.

King Moko specifically was rather daunting, but I made it through the fight by quickly bursting him down with debuffs and sun rods. However the third zone though with wild boars I fucked up real fast and attacked one with my leader and died instantly. That, while frustratingly silly, was totally on me and forgot he'd just counter attack twice. 

Otherwise I played at a bit of a slower more meticulous pace, paying attention to enemies that had effects like giving armor to other enemies, or the enemy that causes aimless on your party and targeted them with cards rather than depending solely on my party. Switching people around to avoid big hits and using weak dummy deployables to tank big hits was very important for fights.

I'm not a fan of card games at all (Slay the Spire being the ONLY other one I play), but it isn't impossible to get into. There are a lot of ways to approach fights with cards, and if you don't figure them out you may struggle a bit with the game since it's less straight forward than Slay the Spire since you have a field of characters to manage that attack independently of played cards like the freeze attacks and such.

TLDR: The game has a lot of charm, the artstyle is lovely, and the music is great. There's a decent variety of build potential with cards, and it is super satisfying to figure out what works with what. It rewards patient play and a bit of experimenting. However, some enemy effects (eg. causing aimless to your party) can be frustrating since the fight partially is out of your control and you have to rely on in hand cards and a bit of luck on top of that.

Overall I'd rate it positively, but a couple battles can prove to be frustrating but it isn't anywhere what I expected from some of the reviews and the 60% rating. Of course it's still an early review so it should be taken with a grain of salt and ideally it could use some adjustments too.","0.52164006233215332","1681457964","true","196","5854","0","16","147","4","0","0"

I kinda forced my way through the game Slay The Spire, but I got all the achievements so I like to think I'm good at these kind of games.

People say this game is badly balanced but I don't agree with that.  The runs are just short so every fight needs to feel lethal.  That being said I do think this game FEELS random.  There is just so much going on in the game that it's super difficult to keep up with and I found myself not understanding how I lost.  Feels like sometimes the stars will align and either you'll just randomly kill the boss or the enemies will just randomly kill you.

I don't even have 6 hours and I already stumbled my way into my first victory.  After that the character you won with becomes the new boss, the game lets you activate special modifiers for a run, and I still have a lot of cards to unlock.

IDK I don't review a lot of games I just don't agree with this being a hard game, just more of a noisy game where there's so much going on.","0.476190477609634399","1681454641","true","333","787","0","10","0","1","0","0"

Fights are absolutely brutal and it does feel just slightly TOO random on how well your run is going to go. The relentless wave of enemies who are OVER buffed just kicks you while your down, meanwhile your companions only...sort of help. The buffs and effects enemies get are far superior to what your team gets. You have little reliable means of killing strong enemies (I'm looking at you Makoko) that sit in the backline, who will then get stronger every turn or after a couple with their super short counters. My opinion? Counters need reworked for companions and enemies, some enemies need to be able to be snowballed more than once, and the next wave countdown needs to be increased. And I think these 3 things alone could help with the insane difficulty spike that comes after beating the first boss. 
Balance issues aside, I believe this game has a lot of potential. Even with how frustrating it is, I find myself starting up a new run over and over because the puzzle element feels great. I enjoy the meta progression, the combat is satisfying when it works, the art and music is absolutely fantastic, and it feels like there is a solid amount of content as of right now. Hopefully the devs follow up with a steady release of patches to bring the game into a place where it stands at the top with other great deck builders!","0.591011226177215576","1681340395","true","142","2763","0","10","0","11","0","0"

I really wish I could recommend it to be people, but right now, it needs some major tuning.

9 times out of 10 I wish I could re-roll because the starting random lineup felt either too slow for how weak they were or too weak for how 'balanced' they were suppose to be. very rarely did I see a stat block and go 'oh ok I can do something interesting with this'.

The enemy onslaught is also pretty brutal for how much RNG there is to deck comps. Lots of damaging enemies pretty early and in huge numbers, where your only cards are really based around your hero...who's stats usually rely on other cards, companions or upgrades to really come online. when RNG smiles and they do, you feel like you actually can make some plays and set stuff up. But that feeling is rare. 

I probably only had 1 'good' run in my time playing (which is ok, games can be hard). when suddenly I entered a fight that seemed unwinnable with anything but a broken cheese strat at that point in the game. Maybe there is a part of the loop I'm not hitting, or a concept I'm misunderstanding, but it feels a little comically brutal at times. 

basically, I think the game is great conceptually and feels fun to play. I'd love to re-visit if there is another pass on the balance, the math feels off.","0","1681441321","false","292","358","0","1","0","0","0","0"

Some roguelikes lean towards player skill and agency, some lean towards RNG, but they all typically find a balance that works for them to make a good game.

Wildfrost misses that margin by gambling 'all in' on RNG to the point it makes casinos look fair. 

There's beautiful art styles, amazing soundtracks, and everything comes together beautifully animated with fitting colors and icons for every mechanic. But the game refuses to give agency to the player and actively pollutes your pool of potential builds to the point of requiring Lady Luck to make it to the final boss. The mechanics are sound and fun, but the runs actively contradict your builds you develop along the way fairly frequently.

-Here's a boss that hits back with *every* attack against it, so hit hard but don't hit too often!
Followed immediately by a boss with 10+ 'Block an ENTIRE instance of damage' shielding points on his already respectable health pool, coupled with fodder that actively adds more of these shields to everyone else when hit and mobs that cause your own team to only ever hit itself.

There's a lot of fun to be had overcoming challenges, but it hits a point, about 3/4 of the way into a run, where it only ever feels like RNG screwing you over because you simply weren't given a way to counter, or even prepare from the start of the run, for the fight.

Add insult to injury, apparently the mechanic for beating the final boss? 
-Copy whatever cheese got you to the end, 
-Juice it,
-Make you die to it next time.

This would be fun if it weren't for the actual cheese you have to pull to get that far. It's either a snowball machine you've no hope of winning against, or a one trick pony to one shot every boss. All of which requires RNG to even build. If they could give agency to the player, it would fix the balancing issue. The fights are hard, sure. They're winnable, yes. But do they rely too much on RNG to get to that point? Definitely. 

It's not fun to beat your head bloody on a brick wall, only to be handed the keys to the kingdom randomly. It doesn't feel validated or satisfying. You can still win and still feel cheated. Give us the tools to overcome the challenges, whatever absurd way it be, not hope and pray for something functional to be handed to us.","0.494817107915878296","1681441064","false","655","695","0","43","0","22","10","3"

This made me hesitant to buy the game at first, but I got it anyway and I'm glad I did.  I disagree with the complaints.  People who think this game is too hard have probably never gotten an Ascension 20 heart kill in Slay the Spire.

I only have about 4 hours in the game so far.  Maybe it will scale up in difficulty as I progress, like Slay the Spire did.  I have finished 2 runs and the game has been quite fun already.  I didn't find it to be too difficult; in fact, on my first blind play-through, I reached what was probably the final boss.  I lost to him because I didn't understand his mechanics, but I think I understand them now and that defeating him should be quite doable.  I think I could have won on my 2nd play-through, but I was playing at 2 AM and due to tiredness left my leader in front of the boss's 50 damage attack when I had plenty of ways to prevent that from happening.  I think I definitely would have won otherwise.  Either way, not bad for a 2nd play-through.  

All that is to say, I don't think this game is too hard at all, and I think it has a lot of interesting synergies that I am eager to explore.  If you have ever gotten an Ascension 20 heart kill in Slay the Spire, then ignore all of the negative reviews complaining about difficulty and balance.  The same can be said if you've ever gotten a max covenant win in Monster Train.  

This game has pleasant art and sound design.  The way you play cards in rows is somewhat reminiscent of Monster Train, but there are other aspects which make the game play feel quite unique, like only playing 1 card per turn (mostly, unless you have a specific buff on a card).  

I'm glad I bought the game.  I have played enough Slay the Spire (about 500 hours) and Monster Train (about 200 hours) that I have been burnt out on both of them several times.  This game scratches the itch for a rogue like deck builder and is unique enough to feel fresh and exciting for me.

Edit: I now have about 16 hours in the game, and I've gotten 5 wins I think.  The balance is perfectly fine.  I would say that there is one fight where enemies have teeth which I think is noticeably harder than most of the other fights, but even then maybe I just haven't learned to deal with teeth properly yet.  This game is not too difficult.  In fact, I'm very satisfied with the level of difficulty.  If you have experience with the rogue-like deck-building genre then I think you will feel the same as me.","0","1681368762","true","279","5007","0","3","0","0","0","0"

You can create an excellent team with great synergy and next fight it is all over. Slay the spire had fights that may be a little harder with a type of deck due to enemies buffing when you do something.. but not as all-in as the battles are here. Barrage and multistrike is fantastic until you meet a team who all have thorns and you can't choose not to attack. Ok snow then, except this team become monsters when you use snow and out-steamroll your snow monsters. Failing to a bit of luck and build elements is fine, failing with a great team because you get a bad matchup is just rubbish - and while I say balancing is the fix, not sure how they go about that as it is so innate to the way the game is designed. I'm unsure if they can get this working even in a year of updates. Apart from that horrible flaw it is excellent.","0","1681439174","false","26","26","0","111","0","0","1","0"

Like any deckbulder game you can be helped or hurt by luck, but I suspect that the vast majority of the time people complain about losing to RNG, they actually lose to poor planning.

With that said it is a very unforgiving game at times. Sometimes it just takes one little mistake to end your run. But practice and experimentation can go a long way to learning how to make things easier.","0.525862038135528564","1681438987","true","636","824","0","3","0","2","0","0"

Art, sound design, UI and pretty much everything else just feels like the devs are experts in their field.
There also seems to be tons of things to unlock that are both very cute and more interesting things to think about.

I just beat the game after 6 attempts and I have to say that combat is always a though puzzle, where you are always required to use your full focus. Just one misstep can mean instant gameover for you. Yet after learning it a little bit it was decently manageable to secure a victory, it also felt super satisfying because the game demands a lot from you.

I can see why this demanding experience wont be for everyone, so maybe there should be another way in which you take turns, perhaps even with an undo button that wont have you risk your whole run with a single mistake.

Overall though, super enjoyable and cute game, I look forward to dig even deeper and see what other challenges this game offers.

Edit: After playing a little more and having beaten it a couple more times I really don't understand the overwhelming cries for balancing. This game is tweaked to precision so that the difficulty is as crunchy as it can be. It's just that this is not a game that you can play while braindead, you actually have to make a plan and execute it. 
The ascension is super fun too, especially since it seems that you get additional powerful starting rewards to balance out the additional difficulty modifiers.

This is an instant classic for me and it's going straight to my favorites list. Especially since it doesn't just take the deck building formula and only slightly tweaks it, but instead actually twists it and turns it into something fresh and better. I absolutely love building a great deck and setting it as the standard that I have to beat in the next run. Such a brilliant idea.","0","1681422013","true","120","3338","0","19","265","0","0","0"

It definitely encourages you to think out every move. It punishes your for mistakes but it doesn't feel unfair. The runs are also short enough that losing doesn't feel terrible. My only outstanding question at this point is how replayable the game is once you beat the boss.

At the time of writing this the game is getting review bombed and I'm not sure why. It definitely doesn't deserve it. People are saying it's too hard and unbalanced. Yes the game is difficult, but to me it feels about the same level of difficulty as Slay the Spire. I've done about 20ish runs or so at this point and made it to the final boss twice. I died there once due to bad luck and once due to my own misplays. I would also disagree that the game is unbalanced. Each playstyle (thorns, poison, frost, etc.) can be super powerful if built into, but they all have their counters. The game will try to find a weakspot in your deck, but you can learn from that and exploit the enemies weaknesses too.

My only problem compared to monster train is runs feel a lot shorter and you dont get as many upgrades. Which doesnt feel as fun to make a powerful deck.

Great things the game does:

When you beat the game your team that beat the game becomes the new end boss for the next run. Amazing because you have to plan your new run on countering your old broken team. Very strategic.

Random starting hero card. So cool rolling the dice and getting a new hero every time.

Bad stuff is RNG can end runs early because you die on like the first boss. Even many runs in this still sometimes happens for me. 

Some enemies are too strong, I hope to get some easy encounters and dread getting others. And a bug for developers to fix, rng ended a run just now where an enemy card had a teeth modifier charm, but the text didnt show up on the card because it already had a full card of text.

All my guys attacked the teeth charm card and died, and I obviously wasnt given a warning in text only the small little charm in the bottom left. Text needs to be scaleable so if it runs off the card it will just put the front smaller to show up on the card.

Pretty good game not the best, but definitely fun for 10-30 hours if this is your thing. Could be the best with more design choice updates and in my opinion a longer compaign allowing you to get more upgrades.","0","1681430325","true","977","1038","0","29","0","1","1","0"

The game also forces you to play a 'leader' without offering any rerolls or any choices if you want to play a specific faction, more often then not i found my self killing my own leader just to start another run where I didn't have 'heal 3 on kill' on a guy with 8 health and 4 attack. The factions are nice with their unique cards but the summoning and snow factions are just plainly better. There's no way to reroll cards, companions or even shops OR at the very least skip them, you HAVE to take that 6th item in your deck of 20+ cards. Lastly on enemies, say you have a killer run just to run into something that hard counters you and die immediately without any counter play unless you have a method of dealing with the problem that you got on your first upgrade area. Here's an example a summoner with strike back 11 health and 7 damage, destroys most everything that hits it, you put a frenzy charm on him, a heal on kill charm and you have the healing pet and a companion to keep him alive. next thing on the 3rd or 4th level you run into either a haze team or a spike team, whether you like it or not you are going to lose, you Have to play the leader and if haze hits him he 1 turns his own team, and if the enemy has spikes then he dies with no way of stopping him from killing himself.

Here's how I would fix this:
1. Make all items and companions have 2 rerolls and the ability to take none.
2. Make it so when you start the game select what faction you want, then offer 3 different people from that faction.
3. Reduce most enemies hp and attack or increase their attack timers or increase the wave counter.
4. Add a way to customize your starting deck, please I beg you, even if it was just a randomizer for your deck.

I'll never refund this game, but if it doesn't get better I doubt peoples interest will remain on it, I hope that the devs improve  the game drastically.","0.618955731391906738","1681425964","false","225","355","0","25","166","10","1","0"

Many people are complaining about the difficulty and even stating that the game does not offer enough options to face the enemies correctly. They are just a bunch of antsy morons who can't play calmly.

This is not Slay the Spire. You don't end the game with 50 cards in your deck and the pacing of the game is slow since you have to consider many things before ending every turn. Wildfrost is its own game.

When you let yourself be immersed in its pacing, it's very gratifying and enjoyable. The art and music complement each other and enhance the gameplay experience.

However, there are some problems. The starting characters aren't very good, so in some cases, you choose the lesser of two evils. Some area cards are bugged, and once you pick them up, you are force to play them. There aren't many bosses, so you end up facing the same enemies after a few runs. You can't see the portion of the map left behind, and you can't skip turns, among a few other things that I hope to see improved in future updates.

Those things don't ruin the game experience. I have enjoyed 10 hours so far and will probably end up playing at least until 25. For $10, I think it's more than good.","0.476190477609634399","1681425447","true","594","888","0","18","0","1","0","0"

The important information is too small with icons that don't express meaning well.
The game is very difficult, so accurately understanding what enemies will do what to which allies is very important. But: The damage amount an enemy will do is on the top-right. The number of targets it will hit in the card text. The number of attacks is an orange rosette at the bottom of the card, not to be confused with the yellow starburst that represents turn countdown. Oh, and don't forget to check your units for a little purple teardrop - that means they'll take double+ damage, in a game with slim health margins. 
The whole game is based around doing this math and shuffling units, so the presentation really does matter here.

Enemies attack first, but poison ticks one last time on your units after you've killed all the enemies, just to guarantee one of your companions is injured for a fight.
An injured companion, even temporarily, means your attempt at a 'build' may be moot for an encounter. Likely the boss encounter.
The bosses I saw all had surprise second phases that were impossible to survive if you took the fight at face value. Bosses already attack both lanes at once, they don't also need to split without warning. Even calling the unit itself 'BossName Phase 1' or something would give me a fighting chance.

I'm less sure about: Everything seems tuned so difficult that I feel the only winning strategy *must* be to play razor's-edge aggressive, which ultimately ends up too random for my tastes. Boss fights all punish slow play in ways that feel unavoidable, so it's go for broke every fight.

I'll keep an eye on the game and see if changes are made going forward! I do love the artwork and style, so much, I just... don't care to keep trying right now.","0.511624157428741455","1681424214","false","144","144","0","108","1090","2","0","0"

The style and art are fun, and There's a lot of cool mechanics to wrap your had around.  The deckbuilding and fights are interesting.  If you're a fan of roguelikes or deckbuilding games it's worth a try.  

From my experience so far it's definitely a punishing game.  There are not many fights in a run and a single mistake can cost you the fight.  Getting some sort of good combo for the first boss is pretty important, and earning enough money to buy a crown at every single shop has been a must for me.  There will be some runs where you just don't hit it, but I've gotten a lot better at making those choices already in the few hours I've played.  It's definitely a challenge, but for me an enjoyable one.  

That said, there are definitely some balancing issues.  Some of the enemies are a lot more punishing than others, even outside the bosses.  There are times when your build gets heavily countered and your chances of winning the round seem slim, without much counter-play.  This is easier to mitigate in a game like slay the spire where there's a lot of fights and more life.  In a game like that, getting countered often means taking a lot of damage.  However, here it could just mean you lose your run.  Even still, I've been getting less of that over time the more I've played.  There are only so many enemy types and it's possible to play around a bad matchup, even if means some of your guys get injured.  Some builds are also just more resilient to that type of thing than others. I found that even in bad match-ups I probably could have won a lot of the time if I played perfectly.

I would like to see something to help mitigate this issue though.  Maybe having an extra round in between fights and adding more companions?  Having max companions and switching out the injured ones could be interesting/viable if you had more of them in your run.  Maybe adding the something like you see in Inscryption where you don't lose a run on a single fight, but rather have 2 or three chances outside of boss battles.  The games are pretty similar in some ways and I think that could help.  Overall though, I've really been enjoying it.","0","1681422637","true","425","1682","0","1","0","0","0","0"

I just wanted to throw this out there because I was heartbroken this game had 'mixed' reviews on steam. Looks like that's almost exclusively due to the difficulty, which is definitely there, I'm just sad that means many people aren't enjoying this beautiful game.

I will say that while difficult, you CAN overcome it. I started off only winning 1/10 runs, but I've slowly gotten to about a 50% win rate with multiple archetypes and combos, and that's just on the second day.

Most of all I've found the difficulty in this game EXTREMELY rewarding. Everything is clearly layed out in front of you.

I love Slay the Spire and have been looking for another game of similar quality for a long time without any success. I have finally found a game capable of competing and it's Wildfrost. There are so many unique mechanics that make it stand out from the sea of StS clones. The meta progression is done in a very clever way, and every run feels unique, as you start with a different leader each time. Getting new cards and items feels extremely impactful and can totally change the gameplay. The art, animations, sound design and UI are all incredible (and in my opinion infinitely better than any competitor).

The reason so many people are giving negative reviews is only because of the difficulty. It's not fair to leave a negative review simply because the game is too hard for you. This game is definitely challenging, but in no way shape or form as impossible as the reviews would make you believe. Every strategy I've tried thus far seems strong enough to be viable. That being said, if you don't like a challenge this game is definitely not for you. You will die multiple times before beating the first boss (as it should be). And numerous more times before even reaching the second boss. You will have to strategize not only in how you play your cards, but also which cards and items you decide to pick up. If you are unable to create a strong combination, you will die. HOWEVER, I'm never upset when I die playing this game. Each death feels more like a mistake on my part than an 'unbalanced' enemy or 'overpowered' mechanic. Some enemies (especially bosses) have extremely unique and strong abilities that demand you form a strategy around them, which makes for some very interesting fights. Not only this, but each death is usually accompanied by some sort of meta progression. This will not necessarily make your fight easier, but instead give you more options and unlock completely new ways to play the game. (horizontal progression)

To sum it up, if you enjoy challenging rogue-like deck builders, this is one of the best ones ever made. If you don't like thinking, and would rather blame 'balancing' then please do not buy, or review this game and ruin it for everyone else.","0.503139615058898926","1681420815","true","192","1326","0","5","126","5","0","0"

I have had runs where I have lost my initial setup only to prevail and live to see another day. I also had runs where I was confident in making it to the end and ultimately lost due to hindsight in letting my leader die. And then, there are runs where the synergies turn the game from a 7 to an 11 as I dominate with 4, 3x attacking Big Berry because yes, it just works.

As a veteran to the roguelike genre, this game is definitely more tricky than the usual roguelike I have played, however, it's definitely a game you can consistently do well in. On my first run alone, I made it pass the second boss. Now, I have beaten the true final boss in only 8 hours of playing with 10 total runs played. What I've learned is that healing is notoriously a tried and tested strategy to guarantee you will make it far. But you should also focus on doing 4 things: racking up money (usually from combo kills and money event space) so that you can buy crowns to set up your forces and combos asap, taking events in this priority order - Money/Shop>Helper(if it isnt capped)>Card removal>Relic>Chest (card reward), focus on 1 type of synergy for your deck that corresponds to your clan, and do not take any cards with side effect with them. If you take these things into account, you'll make it far even if you make a mistake or didn't plan well.

It is very hard, but much like Hades, the game offers you ways to upgrade outside of the runs. I don't think the game is unbalanced for this reason. Some cards need to be modified (I.E. Soul skulls can bond to your hero and cause an instant death and end of the run) and an 'undo' button would be a welcome way to reduce the amount of pain a minor mistake can cause you. I would also recommend a 'hover over' indicator of who is doing damage to what row, as it can be a little difficult to grasp.

Like other games in the genre of roguelike/lite it tends to get easier as you continue, learning better ways to deal with enemies based on what you have, what cards work well together and just generally unlocking more things via the hubs progression. 

For example some of the later enemies have shields that essentially ask for faster attacks over stronger attacks and if you are unaware of how best to incorporate that into your deck you wont have a good time. Crowns are also incredibly important which you may not pick up on at the beginning. 

It does however feel like the beginning has a disproportionate amount of impact on the remainder of your run, if you start with a bad team at the beginning you can easily start to fall behind in terms of resources.","0.50354611873626709","1681415783","true","339","586","0","1","0","1","0","0"

All of the comments seem to be centered on difficulty (losing to the first battle, repeatedly, really?) which is completely undeserved.

Yes, the game has a high degree of randomness to it that keeps things fresh, yes each enemy is very carefully crafted to create a challenge (there is no 'long run up' to the floor boss like there is in Slay the Spire, every wave is dangerous) but there is more than enough luck mitigation to work around this. Even the semi-random heros can all handle the first few fights with reliability, and from there the right charms will fix even a seeming dud of a starter hero. True bad rolls are rare, and even then they're not enough to end a run.

If this game has any sins its that it has changed too many things too quickly and it's confused people. Ability countdowns instead of sequential turns? A hand which doesn't refresh after every turn? Enemy waves? Builds which are built off substantial stat changing 'charms'? It seems clear to me after playing this game for a few hours that people are trying to bring lessons they've learned from other deckbuilders to this game and they aren't seeing why it's not working, but the game itself is brilliantly designed.

My one caveat to this is the Aimless keyword. In a game that is entirely designed around near-complete information it has proven to be a bit of a meta-breaker (cough, Bigfoot enemy, cough). I think the Devs should take a good look at that. Otherwise the game is every bit as well designed on the difficulty side as it is polished visually

Having some visual indication of the effects of the upcoming turn could be great, even if its as simple as a skull above any character or enemy that is about to be killed, something that you COULD work out yourself but is a nice QoL feature that could be implemented.

Overall the gameplay of constructing your side almost as a machine with the different synergies feeding into one another rather than just a bunch of individuals is a really interesting take on a deck builder and the movement of the pieces turn to turn is very fun. However it just feels like you NEED strong synergies as without them you can very quickly hit a wall with no possible way of overcoming the opponents you come up against. 

Feels early access in terms of balance but the ideas and visuals are all very cool. Theres fun to be had although its a cautious recommendation for now.","0","1681406171","true","399","2079","0","5","0","0","0","0"

The game feels and plays great, however there are certain moving parts in the game that can occasionally spell immediate doom with no room for an out. Which is normal for a roguelite, but the fact that you run into a 'no way out' scenario more times than getting by with the skin of your teeth feels a tad bit underwhelming.

There's a lot of information that you lack when you start a run, the boss at the end can completely shut you down if you build improperly and without knowing what's the 'best' setup against the boss ahead, you're unable to make informed decisions when selecting cards for yourself on the way to the boss.

I've done my first clear a couple of hours into playing the game (around 5-6) but am unable to re-do the clear due to certain circumstances. As of writing this there's also no way to skip getting a card, and with the very frequent card distribution you end up with an overly cluttered deck if you don't run into the card remover. An option to skip rewards and have more frequent card removal would be great.

With regard to the upgrade system, you'd typically run into 'dud' upgrades wherein they cause way more harm than benefit, considering that the enemies are already difficult, adding this unnecessary aspect of 'difficulty' really makes you think if spending resources or nodes on upgrades would really help, as several can be 'duds' that either don't fit your deck at the moment, or completely hamper a card's effectiveness.

Overall the game is quite enjoyable, it can get frustrating on several occasions and can sometimes seem outright unfair, however there are a lot of variables and moving parts to this card game and no solid 'sure win strategy'. The game feels very much like trying to scrounge junk to make a functioning machine, it's hard work and requires a lot of knowledge, but the process itself is pretty fun and enjoyable!","0","1681409745","true","838","2785","0","4","0","0","0","0"

The mechanics themselves; the cards, abilities, effects, and companions, all have something really neat, but it's buried under a horribly unbalanced experience. I'm going to start by highlighting what feels incredibly weak on the player's end. 
The hero: Having a choice between three different heroes with random stats and abilities is fine on paper, but Wildfrost's execution of this leaves a lot to be desired. Your hero is frustratingly weak, has long attack cooldowns, and usually an attack stat of MAYBE 3-4. If your hero's death is your losing condition, they should feel more impactful. I know devs might not be the same, but this is the same glaring issue in another game chucklefish published; Wargroove. Another attempt to capture a niche but passionate audience but make lose conditions around losing your commander who has cool abilities and stats, so you are actually given incentive into NOT using them and mainly just keeping them safe. My hero feels weaker than first encounter mobs and can die in two good hits. One of the points of the genre is to start out weak and work your way up, but there is such a thing as too weak to even make it to the first step on the ladder. 
Companions: Cute feature and an added layer of deckbuilding to help guide you to a strong composition. Companions not only taking a card slot but ALSO a turn to put them on the field, is an exercise is design masochism. The enemies will usually have a field of 2-3 enemies, and 3-4 in some later fights. Forcing the player to start out 1v4 is unreasonable given the current card pool and balance state. I think being able to put charms on companions is nice, but I think I would have preferred a level up system where they progress naturally, since I am 4/5 times focusing on putting charms on my much more efficient companions instead of my hero. 
Cards: A basic system that works almost as expected. Again, the turn rotation and action allotment really hurts the experience. I am basically forced to place companions on the board before playing any cards that actually effect my enemies, and even then 4/5 times I am playing cards to keep me from losing instead of bringing me closer to victory. The cards almost feel like an afterthought when you look at Wildfrost's combat through the scope of an autobattler. If heroes could play more than 1 attack card a turn, the deck would feel a lot better to play with. 

Let's talk about enemies and encounters now
Enemies: Battles are randomized in a sense where you will face certain preset compositions picked from a pool. While this can present a challenge in the form that you are facing against a group of enemies that synergize with one another, it is also ball busting at times since they are much more optimized than you, the player can hope to be. Compounded with the fact that their board fields with units without a need to use a turn of action, you are often felt like you are fighting uphill the entire encounter. It doesn't feel rewarding to beat some of these encounters since not only do you not get anything besides currency, they don't feel like true wins since likely had just scrounged up protection for your hero and had cool downs tick at the right times. Enemy cooldown times are also extremely in their favor. If their abilities and attack stats were not so strong, this wouldn't be as big an issue, but whenever even ONE enemy is ready to do their move next I feel like I am forced to either slow them down, kill them somehow, or just accept that I'm making something eat the attack. Enemy compositions will likely appear that are an exact counter to your current build. Again, it wouldn't be so bad if the balance was in a better place. 
Map encounters: Cute idea, but not enough steps and impact on the run. I feel like with how powerful the enemies are, I need at least another rest spot or two to appropriately gear me for the next one. 

Overall, while this game has some decent art and nice groundwork for its mechanics, I can't suggest anyone pay the 20 bucks it costs just to run into the balancing problems a lot of people are facing. If decks, heroes, and companions were more in our control, yeah the difficulty could be managed as you can find a consistent way to overcome the encounters, but when you're thrown a bunch of weak combos that will not get you further than 2-3 battles, it just feels bad. I sincerely hope the developers take some of the feedback to heart and try to tackle the game's balance a little. It would be a shame for a project like this to just fade into the basement tote of generic and unsatisfying deckbuilders.","0.527707993984222412","1681408952","false","122","122","0","3","0","8","0","0"

There are a couple of things I'd like to see implemented to improve it. 1. Let us skip choosing a card. (that is just a deck building fundamental) 2. The boss difficulty curve is a bit steep. I'm fine with the difficulty but it ramps up a bit to quickly in a play through.

What this game does well, this game does very well, and it is a unique and fresh take on the deck builder genre. I feel most reviews are blowing things way out of proportion.

No, the game isn't impossible or unbalanced, but its challenges have sharp teeth that require you to navigate its encounters carefully, sometimes very precisely, to make it through each run. The game's combat is a strategy game with a lot of depth; you have to hide your hero safely, shuffle your positioning constantly to divide incoming damage, and use every tool in your arsenal to solve problems by delaying or defeating especially vicious enemies. The ways out of bad situations aren't obvious, but they are there, and the more you grow accustomed to the game's strict sequencing, the easier and more exciting they become to see.

That aside, this is an extremely fun game, and much more approachable than its initial reception would make it seem. A roguelite deckbuilder where deploying creatures and managing tough board states (comparable to Monster Train) makes up the bulk of its gameplay, with a really smooth pacing of single encounters against multiple waves and a boss chopped up by several upgrade/modification/event/shop/removal nodes in a row. You get a ton of back-to-back upgrade options for your loadout, which are extremely customizable as upgrades are handled by finding Charms that add keywords, stat modifications, etc. to applicable cards you have, with each card being able to hold up to three--by the end of each run, you could be playing with many cards you've seen before, but ended up with totally different versions of them depending on what upgrades you found. This is a really fun system and adds a lot of inherent variety to the game (and comes back at higher difficulties to add the same kind of variety to basic enemies.)

It takes a very delicate hand to make a game that constantly gives you a feeling that you're not going to make it through this encounter, but as you play to your outs, you'll be surprised by the fact that you can, and it'll always be on the back of many different cards and mechanics working together exactly as well as they need to. The enemy designs are tight and varied, with bosses asking very different things of you to make sure you have tools to handle many different challenges, and there's a twist on the final boss design that gives you a very clear warning about what you need to be able to handle by the end of the run.

Finally, I'm not sure what more I could add to what's already been said for the game's style. It's to die for. There's so much joy, energy, and personality in every single inch of the game. I've finally put the game down to sleep and I'm still hearing that catchy battle theme. 

If you like deckbuilders, card games, roguelites--the whole genre, definitely give this game a try. And if you did, and you find yourself struggling and frustrated with it, I would encourage you to give it a little more patience. The game requires different approaches to its challenges than its neighbors, but if you really pay attention to all the tools at your disposal, you'll find a deeply rewarding game here.

Also, it really bothers me to see some people blaming difficulty on luck. The game has very little combat RNG. You see your whole deck in 2-3 hand cycles; I've had a run where after enough removals I drew my entire deck on every redraw. The rules for targeting are clear, and even Aimless can be reasonably manipulated, especially incoming attacks.

Some cards/units seem so much better than others, with many looking underwhelming in their base forms--this feels intentional, because the way upgrades scale with game mechanics is multiplicative. A small ATK boost on a unit with Barrage or Frenzy adds up very quickly. An innocuous AoE spell in your deck could suddenly become a win condition by attaching an on-hit delay to it. And unlike traditional deck-building games like Slay the Spire, you can draw into your whole deck so quickly that once you've assembled a strategy, your access to it becomes extremely consistent, as at any point you can pass one count to redraw 6-7 cards. Every shop has an affordable option to select a card in your deck and play it at the beginning of every encounter.

The game has so many systems designed specifically to give you consistency and control. But it doesn't give you solutions to its challenging encounters for free. You have to be perceptive to the unrealized potential of each card for things as simple as having a promising keyword to work with, and build around strong synergies, rather than expect to find a single completed item to round out a single approach.

I feel that I have to address criticisms like this just because I don't want others to miss this gem of a game because of negative first-reactions that fundamentally misunderstand it.","0.748382210731506348","1681366926","true","471","3208","0","10","0","77","0","0"

A lot of the reviews I am seeing are either 'game too hard wah' or 'git gud loser'. I think there is a lot more nuance than that.

Pros: 
Art is consistently charming and engaging
Card Archetypes have a lot of potential
Meta progression is something to work towards but not needed to win the game
The three factions are unique although the dwarf one seems kinda bad
Complete game, no bugs
Very fun game run to run, gets you in that one more run mentality for sure

Cons:
Hard to say if this game is poorly balanced or if it requires a different way of thinking than other deck builders, but does seem really difficult
Your deck choices are very limited at the beginning of the run sometimes leading to situations where it can be an auto lose on the 2nd fight 
Picking from 3 random heroes does not really work for this game because there are 3 factions so if I wanted to do a run as the snow faction I might only have one choice of hero (and sometimes heroes cant even clear stage 1 by themselves)
The enemies you fight are HEAVILY specialized if your deck has a small weakness to an enemy archetype it can feel like a done deal right at the start of combat
The game could really benefit from giving you more cards it feels like such a challenge to get any kind of cohesion in a deck often leading to just picking the best card in a vacuum as oppose to the best card for synergies

In it's current state the game is hard to recommend unless you are really looking for a new deck builder and don't mind some growing pains if not I would wait for sale. Or if you just cant resist the funny characters.","0.523809552192687988","1681406140","true","140","239","0","3","353","1","0","0"

This game is Super fun. Great mechanics, Beautiful art, and fun characters every run. This game has the potential to be as fun as Slay the Spire! (Which I have 600+ Hours played might I add.)

However, it FEELS terribly unbalanced. You can have a really fun run with a cool build going with the first 2 or 3 fights. All to get ruined by a single enemy with 30 attack/10 shields or 20 health/5 Spikes that you can't touch in the back row as it's allies continue to buff it. AND with another wave of enemies to fight after that. I know it claims to be challenging but moments like these happen and I feel so defeated. It doesn't feel challenging it feels rigged to get me to lose and try again. Which doesn't feel good. 

Some things to adjust,
Decrease starting Teeth/Shell stats. 
     Teeth - Enemies start with 2-3 teeth and by the time attack turns start, they can have 5-10 teeth and that can destroy most units with their first attack.
     Shell - Mostly had an issue with the Single enemy that deals damage based around it's shell total. Starting with TEN shell and 2 attack is far too much. It's already more then enough to kill the general Hero/Companion pool without trying. By the time I have a chance to attack them in the back lanes, they have been buffed to to 15-20 which which is impossible to deal with with scrappy swords and stalling tactics.
Maybe increase the Scrappy swords by a point. I find myself not using them by the 3rd battle because them become so useless.

Again, these are my first opinions about the game so they are bound to change as I keep playing, which I plan on doing so. There is a LOT of potential here to be a wicked fun game to keep coming back too. But so far I haven't been challenged by the game, I have only been utterly defeated by things out of my control. Maybe it's Luck or my Strategies but I'm hoping things smooth out as I keep playing.","0","1681405869","true","229","1494","0","5","251","0","0","1"

Furthermore, the game is too heavily reliant on RNG. Players have little to no control over their decks and cannot even skip cards if they don't want any of the three presented. The difficulty is not based on skill, but rather on luck. Building synergies is difficult as it all comes down to luck whether you can even develop them. In most cases, players are forced to include cards in their decks that don't fit their team at all. As a result, every run feels more like a game of chance, and players already know they've lost against certain bosses if they don't have the right charms or abilities. The game looks great, and I wish it were more fun to play.","0","1681405754","false","485","3961","0","2","0","0","1","0"

Fuck this a hard one to write because while I do love so many many aspects of this game, and probably will keep playing it. I do get why it's getting a mixed score. Usually, I don't write reviews but for card games in particular I feel like I have enough experience to properly rate them somewhat.

Do I think the game is a horrible mess? No. Do I think it's as good as the genre mainstays like Slay the Spire and Monster Train, also No but it can be. It has some AMAZING qualities, the art style of course, the faster-paced gameplay, and I really like the combat that puts so much emphasis on the countdown mechanics etc. However as many have stated the game is wildly unbalanced or at least unbalanced enough that it feels like it's impossible to have good runs. I definitely feel like this issue can be fixed, I am not a developer so I can't say how, but I know it's possible! And I still have hope for this game

The developers have made an amazing game and I really hope they take in the good that they've made here, this is a strong foundation. The clock that you use to refill your hand is such a neat mechanic. Injuries make you feel like you're a team rather than a deck of cards. This game doesn't just present a game like Slay the spire it presents a world silly as it might be.

If the release is the end of the road for this game, then I am happy enough with the product even if I don't recommend it. However, if this game gets a balance update and maybe just a few updates I think this can be a gem!

I beat the final (final) boss and I can see why people are complaining about the game being difficult, but that's what makes good roguelike games. It would not be fun if you could just brainlessly steamroll everything. My advice to new players is if they are familiar with other deckbuilders, the key is to make your deck concise so when you redraw, you get the same set of tools. You will just need to know what can handle what scenarios. The difficulty really is just a learning curve like all roguelikes. 

Also a UX suggestion for the devs: add death previews when it's obvious. For example if an item is obviously going to kill an enemy, have an X show up or something. Conversely, when an ally is obviously going to die at the end of the turn at a position, make it highlight red or something. With the number of things happening in this game, sometimes players can miss the obvious (I certainly have o-o) and this will make the game possibly feel easier.

I really enjoy the core gameplay, you and your enemy's cards being on two separate lanes leads to tough decision-making situations and the cards you find throughout your run can have neat interactions with one another thanks to interesting but simple to understand keywords and card effects.
Wildfrost feels hard but rarely in a mean way, some runs do end prematurely but i feel like that's just the game punishing misplays (perhaps too harshly for some).

I'm obviously not far enough into the game to comment on how balanced it actually is, so i'll just say that the difficulty hasn't really lead to any strong frustration for me so far.  If you've played card battlers like this before and don't mind being slapped around a bit when you first get into a game, i recommend Wildfrost ! 

If you're more of a casual enjoyer or the idea of doing ascensions in Slay the Spire repulses you, you should probably wait until some balance patches and maybe even difficulty options are introduced before you make the jump.","0.527559041976928711","1681401255","true","106","1691","0","181","1765","1","0","0"

This game is good. I experienced a bit of the demo and I'm at nearly 6 hours of play - I beat my first run a couple hours ago, and I'm really impressed with how unique the game is. There's elements of Monster Train and Spire in this, with an especially interesting counter system that counts down to unit actions. There's a ton of room for depth, and what's here is challenging, fun, and (perhaps most importantly with so many roguelike deckbuilders out there) distinctive.

Negative reviews are complaining about the difficulty, for the most part (lots of curious eyes turned toward the 'balancing'). I have yet to explore the full depth of the game, but there's nothing about the mechanics that feel especially broken or unfair. There's a bit of a knowledge game to be played early on, where you'll have to familiarize yourself with the different kinds of enemies the game can throw at you, but this is nothing new if you've played deckbuilders. Having to think about how your deck fares against different enemy builds encourages planning and being critical of your deck's needs, and the combo-kill system adds incentive to be creative and thoughtful even in the early/easy fights.

The art style might make some folks think this is supposed to be a cute and easy game (it is cute!). It's definitely not easy. Making the most of the game's many challenging situations is something I'm looking forward to in future playthroughs, and if anything changes I may visit this review with an update.

However, there are a few issues that I have with the mechanics/descriptions that the game fails to inform you of correctly.

Firstly, I was under the impression that aimless meant the enemy or ally could even hit someone that was on their team, this does not seam to be true and honestly I prefer it that way but the wording for the description of aimless makes it unclear.

Secondly, and this is why I believe I need to rate the game poorly, mechanics such as soulbound skulls do not work as described. It and items similar to it specifically state that it targets a random ally. In my best run (thank the RNG gods) I used the item and it soulbound my leader which meant that I could not kill the enemy I needed to or I would die... The enemy I soulbound was the boss soooo that did not work out for me.

My third major issue is in reference to me thanking the RNG gods because like many have previously stated the difficulty spike in this game is insane. I've played games like Slay the Spire, One Step From Eden, Ring of Pain, Darkest Dungeon, and Inscryption yet this somehow feels much greater in difficulty and what many people are calling out as only a few viable builds are correct.

I desperately want the developers to fix these issues and I know the game was only recently released, but these are my issues and I hope the feedback pushes the ball forward in terms of Wildfrost being improved.","0.508196711540222168","1681399114","false","176","573","0","1","0","2","0","0"

Pros
The animations and city building aspect are great.  Randomized heroes are fun.   

Cons
The not being able to pass on a card mechanic is tiresome. 
The balance is, as others have said, a little out of whack.
It's very tedious and grindy after a few runs, and not in a fun way like Slay the Spire.
The insane amount of passives the enemies have vs what you can actually get.
There doesn't seem to be a wide variety of cards to chose from.

The challenge level is high, and deckbuilding veterans might feel like the game is outright unfair, especially in the period before they've mastered the mechanics that set Wildfrost apart from other games in the genre.

Shuffling characters around on the board is free, and later in runs, essentially necessary to do every turn to absorb enemy attacks. Characters can be withdrawn from the field to save them from death, but this takes them off the field, and occasionally it's better to let them die, leaving the injured for the next fight but absorbing an extra blow to take you through the current one.

The game can sometimes feel unfair, and certain mechanics feel slightly underpowered. The difficulty right off the bat feels like it would be more appropriate for a playthrough one third the way through ascencion levels rather than brand new players. It leaves little room for experimentation, and each lost run feels like a big investment of effort.

Regardless it's an interesting and very charming take on the genre.

Enemies are overtuned as all hell, with everything past the first fight able to wipe you out of nowhere. Random fights will completely stonewall certain builds with no way to fight back, and many bosses are straight up unwinnable without a broken build. Which is exceedingly rare with how stingy the game is with handing out cards and charms.

The cardbuilding aspect is the biggest disgrace here. More than half the cards are useless if you ever hope to win, and there's an absurd amount of detrimental cards and charms seemingly put in as a cruel joke from the devs . 

There is a way to make things easier...but that involves forgoing cards and just stacking charms. And at that point, can you even call this a deckbuilder game?

Action economy is everything: one card = one turn. Each turn, every character on the field ticks down by 1 - and when they hit 0, they activate and do their thing. Additionally, enemies attack first, so even if your units have the same timer, they can very likely perish.

This means three things:
(1) Companions are better cards to than most of the effect cards, because they'll activate repeatedly AND be removed from your deck AND can tank hits for you/leader.
(2) Crowns [80g item] are the best item in the shop, and the one you should make sure you can always buy. A Crown on a card means that it can be played at the start of the game for free - giving you an extra minion on the board, casting a spell for free, etc; it's a 100% draw+play at no cost (minus the one-time 80g cost).
(3) The fact that your minions get weaker for the next combat after they die is ATROCIOUS. While I said companions are generally better cards to play - this is due to their stats:activation time ratio - something that is significantly weakened should they die in a fight; and makes them detrimental cards to play (since your 1 turn playing can = 6 enemy turns ticking down). If you play a minion with the same turn timer as the enemy - it's going to get hit first, and likely die - moreso if it's still injured from the prior battle.

This isn't a puzzle game, it's a punishment game. 

Frankly, there's a lot of times where there's straight up nothing you can do to play around the enemy/board state - and on top of that, each battles designs/mechanics are extremely polarized - you either might be able to deal with it (if lucky opener+having the cards in your deck at all), or you simply cant [and there's no way to determine ahead of time what a fight might be].

Honestly, this game tries to copy Quantum Protocol's gameplay, but without the designs/mechanics that actually let you get ahead on the board; despite 1 card = 1 turn for the field. If the combat is the part of the game you like most about this game, you'd do well to at least check that game out, as it's a deckbuiler-puzzle game as well (don't forget as long as it's been less than 2h playtime+2weeks owned, Steam will allow you to automatically refund a game).","0.523189127445220947","1681396048","false","58","58","0","26","0","9","2","1"

Pro:

The artstyle is a 10/10 but that's really the only positive i have to say 😅

Cons :

The gameplay is a real real simplified version of the game 'nowhere prophet'

At the start of a run you have to choose between 3 random leaders but the starting decks are always the same 

You have almost no customization options for your deck since you barley get new cards / people to play 

Something that annoys me personally like heck is the fact that the game is 90% RNG based and you CANT skip adding stuff to your deck ( like seriously every descend deckbuilding rouge like has that )

If your leader dies it's game over but most common enemies are easily able to one shot your leader 

You get the illusion of a path but it's just a straight line 

Each battle and boss is always the same (which is very unusual for a rouge like and also a terrible choice )

If you're looking for a good card based rouge like that's not slay the spire or monster train then i really recommend knock on the coffin lid it's still in early access but already offers way more content and better balances than wildfrost","0.503759384155273438","1681395045","false","353","1817","0","12","0","2","0","0"

I originally wanted to play this game just because of its cutesy artstyle but I was certainly not expecting to have such a fun and interesting experience. 

This game does have its flaws though. The difficulty spike is INSANE. After like two runs the first boss feels like nothing, but each and every other fight afterwards has the potential to snowball out of control, if you neither play smart or win fast. One careless mistake could lose you the run, so awareness and strategy are key. Each and every fight has a boss in it, but before they appear there are also minion waves which get way too strong if not as strong as the boss after a while. I needed 6 hours to even beat the fourth boss, but I rarely even got to the third. Wildfrost is certainly not easy, but that's exactly what makes it so interesting to me.

If they lowered the difficulty of the boss fights and increased the distance between the fights for more reward possibilities (e.g. more smaller fights inbetween to test new cards, more options for new cards) it would certainly catch more attention from the more casual as well as hardcore crowd. But in the meanwhile, I'll try my best to beat it while it still feels hellish.

TL;DR: Needs optimizations to difficulty and deckbuilding options, but is certainly a fun and unique game with an amazing artstyle.","0","1681393677","true","444","1009","0","19","0","0","0","1"

This game is super addicting, props to  the numerous challenges and the difficulty. Yes, I may understand some of the bad reviews saying that this game is stupidly impossible. Yes, I may also understand that some of the mechanics are unpleasant. The truth is, most of the time this game works like Chess or Tic-Tac-Toe. It's almost like a puzzle. You need to be 1-2 turn(s) ahead of your opponent. If not, it's game over pretty quickly. DON'T  BE AFRAID TO RING THE BELL EVEN THO IT'S NOT FREE YET. Having the cards that you need is important.

Now that the difficulty is out of the way, let's focus on the game itself. Everything from an artistic point of view is perfect. The art style, the sound effects, the music, the animations, the story, etc. Everything fits its purpose perfectly. The sounds are SOOO satisfying. 

For me, personally, the negative points are the random events and the factions. There's like 7 random events, which 3 of them have to be unlocked through playing. For the factions don't get me wrong, they are super great, unique in their own ways... But the fact that you have to choose a faction at the start of your run makes the game kind of blend after a couple of tries. You get stuck with THAT faction cards for your entire run. I think what they should have done here is to get rid of the factions and just let you pick any cards with any randomly generated hero. It sure removes the identity of each faction, but it 3x the cards that you could get, which improve the replay value by a miles.

Anyway, this game is still amazing. A bit pricy for what it is though. If you REALLY enjoy card games, like myself, I think you'll appreciate it. If your not a big fan, maybe wait for a sale.","0","1681392375","true","681","2347","0","33","234","0","0","0"

Nah but for real this game does take some time reading through some effect and thinking what those consequence might bring. I'd say it's pretty punishing if you don't think about it especially with the bosses. Can't say much since I only played a bit but so far i'd say you are as broken as the enemies you face like literally you have to face yourself which is pretty cool.

8/10 I like the game it's not easy nor too hard, art is fantastic, game play is smooth and it feels satisfying doing combos.","0.503018498420715332","1681391802","true","215","1565","0","1","99","5","0","0"

In most games, of this kind, such as Slay the Spire, you get like 30 choices of cards to add to the deck, events to get things that change your playstyle etc. over the course of a run. That gives you the ability to minimise the effect of RNG, so you can strategise and make the most of a bad situation if it comes to that.

This game gives you about 9. This means the enemies ramp up quickly and so the only successful runs will be the ones where you get extremely lucky. There's no chance to mitigate bad RNG. You just don't get the opportunity. You have to hope every time you get a card or charm that it's the exact one you need. 
As a result, the 'rebuild and restrategise' that's advertised, just isn't there. You roll the dice again and hope you get lucky.","0.470454245805740356","1681388998","false","328","329","0","47","517","3","0","0"

The game looks and feels great, all the animations are quick, but not bland at all. Playing cards, equipping charms, inspecting enemies - it all feels very polished and responsive. To me, this is where the comparison to other deckbuilding games kind of ends. 

I read reviews on here stating the poor balance. I have not beat the game once within 6 hours, but I don't chalk it up to the balancing at all. The fighting just plays out very differently from other deckbuilders and is very much a hybrid of 'Card-Battler' and 'Auto-Battler'. To be honest, I'd wager it's more of the latter than the former. The deckbuilding part is integral to assemble tools that work with your 'Champion', but since every card played progresses the minions on the board, I really get a different vibe from this game. To beat this game is to keep good notice of the board state and predicting every interaction, that is to happen withing the next few turns. Very rarely will you have 'easy turns' in this game, where you comfortably know what cards are optimal to play this turn. 

As with Monster Train, which has a similar deviation from the standard card-battler formular, I can see myself playing a long time, trying to defeat the game with every possible deck-archetype. However I could also see myself getting bored within 10 more hours, as the optimal combinations of minions, charms and abilities grow more obvious. How much variety the gameplay offers then, we'll have to see.

Thumbs up for great visuals, a very polished feel (emphasis on that, few deckbuilding games have given me this) and interesting battle-mechanics. Doubtful I'll play 300 hours in this, but 20 hours in a well crafted world with a theme are fine by me.

Suggestion: add 'Auto-Battler' tag, it's very much at the core of Gameplay in my eyes.","0.496774196624755859","1681387872","true","382","655","0","2","0","0","0","0"

Some of these negative reviews complaining about it have their authors freely admitting that they have died repeatedly to the penguin fight at the start of each run, a fight that is, to be honest, brainless. Like, completely brainless. Why would I trust any game balance opinion you have after that, lmao. 

The game is, however, uncompromising and complex. Each battle consists of many factors you have to keep track of to avoid losing and it doesn't hold your hand or warn you when you're taking a run-losing action or ignoring something vital. You can move your units freely around the battlefield and the game expects you to take full advantage of this in order to win and will punish you if you do not. It certainly asks a bit more of you right from the get-go than most roguelike deckbuilders do, with the vanilla run difficulty clocking in as somewhere a few Ascension levels up in Slay the Spire, for example.
I think a lot of people got lured in expecting something a lot more casual due to the game's cutesy aesthetic and are experiencing some dissonance from that. But don't be fooled. This game is a remarkably refreshing experience and has a lot to offer to people who are actually good at card games, roguelikes, reading, etc. A breath of fresh air in a fairly stagnant subgenre. 

I have some small complaints and nitpicks. I'd like a skip button for card picks, for example, even if your deck-size is always pretty small. The redraw bell and companion reshuffle help-tips could stop showing up so often past the tutorial. But the game's difficulty is good.

I've played demo for hours and hours and it's a blast to finally touch the real thing.

The gameplay is quite original. I spent a lot of time on Slay the Spire, which is also a Deckbuilder/Roguelike, but it has a completely difference turn system which is very fresh. Each action has a great impact on the game, and you need to think wisely about if using that card is worth a turn, or not.

Graphics and musics are just perfect. I'm a sucker for this art style.

I see a lot of people posting negative reviews because of balancing problems. I can agree that some mechanics are clearly more powerful than others, but that's also the fun of it, discovering what works or not. I'd like to see corrections and new mechanics added in the future, but for the time being, I think it does the work well enough. My only real critic would be that we have too little control over the contruction of our deck. More ways to banish a card or reroll a treasure would certainly be a nice addition.

It is quite a difficult game, that's for sure. I don't see it as a negative though, quite the opposite. Just take that into consideration if you're not a big fan of struggle.

Having played A20 Slay the Spire and C25 Monster Train, there is just something about this game that makes it un-fun, which has nothing to do with the difficulty.

- It limits you to playing one card per 'turn' (at least in the opening stages) which makes me wonder why this has to be a card game in the first place.
- Lack of variability of enemies, combined with the overall slow pacing of the game. This game doesn't have the 'one more run' feel to it.
- Not being able to tell what transpired during a turn. When there is a turn with multiple attacks, it is impossible for me to tell where a buff/nerf is coming from. There is no after turn summary or any way to identify the source of buff or nerf for any creature. 
- Many cards/items are locked through a grind-fest, which is a really weak way to create progression especially for this genre.","0.569830715656280518","1681382584","false","108","108","0","11","538","9","1","0"

The game combined an adorable artstyle with a high difficulty where it's uncertain whether or not you'll make it one third of the way into the run. The full game did not disappoint me at all -- compared to the demo, the runs have been expanded to include 2 more acts, and there many unlockables for future playthroughs.


The game features wonderful artwork with a cartoony cel-shaded artstyle. All of the character cards have a personality to them, and I was surprised to see that some of the cards would change their appearance depending on actions you take in combat. Blood would splatter on their fronts, a monster would grow depending on how enraged it got and an ally would increase the size of the snowball in their hands after you power her up.

Added to that are various interactive UI elements that react to your actions -- bell relics swing and produce noise when you hover your mouse over them, upgrades are presented as trinkets on a keychain that you can attacks to your units. The various locations you visit also have satisfying animations for interacting with them, be it breaking a slab of ice or feeding your cards to Muncher. This makes the game really fun from an aesthetic point of view, it's simply a joy to look around the interface.


The combat itself seems to be an involved version of an autobatter: you play down unit cards, and they automatically attack targets (or use abilities) after their cooldown is complete. In addition to that, you can play skill cards to influence the battlefield yourself, applying status effects and doing direct damage to units. In between turns, you're free to move any and all of your units around the field, choosing who is going to be at the front to take damage, who can be sacrificed to the incoming heavy hit, and who should be sent back to your deck to recover some hitpoints. Other than these actions, each card you play takes exactly 1 turn to resolve, causing enemies to act immediately, even before your own units.

This causes the game to be all about reacting to the puzzle presented in front of you on each of the turns. How do you take the least amount of damage? How can you kill the most enemies in a single turn, as doing so makes them drop more loot? Can you afford to leave this character out, or should you play it safe and heal it up, resetting its attack timer and having to play it out again later?


The downside of this, is that the battlefield can get rather complex, with multiple enemies and allies triggering each other's abilities, some of which might be unclear to a new player or someone who's not in the mind to pay complete attention to the game. I have lost several runs simply because I forgot about a keyword an enemy had, causing them to hit my hero instead of the default target and losing me the game. The combat is unforgiving -- you're not given warnings or previews about the following turn, though you do get a battlelog where you can see what went wrong. One mishap that kills your hero, and you need to start over (or close the game to reset the combat if you don't mind cheating).


Once you're dead, the game will show you the progress you've made towards unlocking new content. You can get different units to add to your starter deck, which are pets in this game; you can unlock new charms to find in your runs, which represent the game's upgrades; you can also unlock new locations to visit during a run and new factions to play, which feature their own decks and playstyles. 

I'm personally not a fan of meta-progression in games, though I think the way Wildfrost does it is fairly fun. At the same time I do feel that putting some of the encounters behind an unlock barrier feels a little unsatisfying to me. Additionally, the way the game's 'hub' is organized is that you have ~8 different buildings. After you click on one of them, the NPC inside will show you what type of unlock you can get, and what you need to do to get it. This means that if you want to see all of the challenges you need to complete, you have to keep clicking back and forth between these locations -- and they're spread out all around the screen in a scrollable scene in buildings that aren't easy (for me) to identify the purpose of at a glance.

I would love it if there was a list detailing all the quests in a single menu screen, like the one they have for achievements, and if there was a side panel using which you could switch between all of the buildings without having to scroll or look for the right one.

The game's 'ascension' mode where you increase the difficulty of the game after completing it is also quite interesting -- you both get penalties and boosts for doing so. The first two difficulty increases make it so enemies have a chance to be upgraded (while dropping more gold) and the waves come out one turn quicker (but your starting unit is played down for free on the first turn).


Having enjoyed this game so much, it was a surprise to me just how many people found it unfun. I read the reviews stating that this is one of the worst deckbuilders around, that it has no sense of balance, that no matter how you build or upgrade your deck, you're bound to lose due to how much stronger the enemies are, that there is absolutely no variety in viable builds. Now, usually I wouldn't fanboy over a game I like just because it received harsh criticism, however, in this case it feels to me that the reviews like that are misleading.


My opinion is that the game's balance is fine. I was capable of winning my run immediately after finishing the tutorial, but I lost because of a mistake. I won my first run on my 4th attempt, and my second one on an increased difficulty on my 10th attempt. The majority of my losses were down to me not fining a solid end-game strategy by the middle of act 2, or because I didn't pay enough attention and got my hero killed. Both of these are fine in this line of games -- you're not [b]meant[/b] to win every run. Some runs are you barely scraping by with a semblance of a deck you cobbled together, while others have you farm a ton of gold with an absurd build you were given. 

The deck variety felt good. It seems to me that you can win using a variety of strategies, [b]however[/b] the game will not let you win if you put all of your eggs in one basket. You're not going to win with a 'poison deck' because that's likely to be weak against many smaller units, or with a 'thorns deck' because that's weak against high-hitting enemies, or with a 'heal deck' because you can't heal if you're dead to a 40 damage attack.


The game will present challenges to you, and you need to be able to answer them appropriately -- you need to tank damage, to kill many small enemies quickly, to kill single large enemies, to put all your pieces on the board, etc. The way to do that is to know what challenges you'll be presented with, and what answers you can use against those challenges, both of which require knowing the game. Of course, sometimes you don't find the best answer, so you might have to settle for some mid option instead, but that's kind of the appeal of roguelikes to me. This mindset helped me get through all of my winning (or close-to-winning) runs, and it is what I feel many people who are dissatisfied with the game's balance are missing.","0.549549520015716553","1681380899","true","619","2769","0","15","258","2","0","0"

There's a lot of reviews already claiming this game to be too hard or have difficulty spikes. I don't mind when a game is challenging, if anything i prefer it, it keeps things interesting and engaging. 

This game however does not feel challenging, it feels unfair. I rarely (if ever) feel I could have made different choices to have changed the outcome upon defeat leaving me with little to nothing to learn from. The way the enemies are balanced, their abilities and base stats, feels as though they expect you to have a powerful build put together by the time you get them but provides so few ways to manipulate your deck building to create a deck with enough synergy. Even in the few times I DO get solid deck together getting through an encounter is sketchy at best.

There's a lot of potential here though. Some adjustments to the games balance whether it be providing more deck manipulation, weighted synergy RNG, or reduced enemy numbers could very easily bring the game into a great spot and change this review. But as it stands currently it is an unsatisfying experience.","0.539363503456115723","1681371629","false","523","1424","0","2","0","3","0","0"

I do not think the balance is that bad, people just haven't learned the game yet. The art is perfect, the animations and sound effects, the music are all wonderful.

The entire campaign is somewhere around 10 battles that are extremely intense. Some of them include deck checks that are complete bs if you don't know they're coming. It's one of those games where you spend the entire time thinking, 'How do I lose?' instead of 'how do I win?'

Some events like the muncher (thins your deck) and charms (too easy to get something useless for your deck) sound good but end up being noob traps because having a follower synergy is way more important. Now those events wouldn't be useless if the campaign was longer and you actually had some time to refine your deck, but you don't. Likewise, the shortness of the campaign also makes certain synergies not viable because you probably won't have time to put it together.

You need to be ready to fight tooth and nail for every inch you manage to pull from the clutches of the mostly overwhelming odds stacked against you.  You need to think five steps ahead each turn if you want to survive.  Towards the end of a good run every fight becomes the equivalent of a boss fight in another game.  You're essentially doing a boss run.  Every run.

There will be times when you will come across impossible odds, morale sapping opposition that offers no winnable solution.  Take a breath, take your time, plan out your moves.  Execute your plan.  And if you manage to snatch an impossible victory from the inescapable jaws of defeat... prepare to do it all again before you reach the midboss of this one area because that was just a fight with some random lackies.

You don't necessarily know exactly what you're going to encounter, but for the most part the enemies are very similar in each zone, and y. The art is cute and the musical composition is great (although several hours of hearing the same music will get old.) I do also appreciate how the mechanics are well-explained (if you right-click on cards) and enemy actions are always (with the one exception of [spoiler]Aimless[/spoiler] as well as [spoiler]enemies who explicitly have 'apply X to random enemy' modifiers[/spoiler]) predictable. Same goes for your own turns.

The comments about balancing are somewhat unreasonable - this game hasn't been out even a day, much less had time for people to develop proper strategies for this. I had some exposure to the game from watching a streamer play it prior to launch, and you definitely can develop a strategy to go forward, even if it's not 100% successful. Yes, it's hard, and you die a lot, and there's RNG (like any roguelike), but it is one of those games that requires time spent to unlock more and get used to the mechanics to make your runs more successful. The RNG is primarily constrained to what cards/charms you get, as with most any deckbuilder.

To the devs: there [i]may[/i] be opportunities to change the balancing in the future, but please wait a bit and see what community forms around this game first before completely nerfing it.

Anyway, I didn't consider myself a fan of this genre, but this game's charm drew me in and the slowly expanding mechanics makes it very replayable.","0","1681362895","true","77","5535","0","41","0","0","0","0"

I don't expect games in this genre to be easy, but this game is difficult to a fault. You're constantly thrown against seemingly unwinnable odds. After nearly 2 hours, I only beat the first boss once. The runs don't last long enough for you to experiment or learn anything as a new player which i think is the main issue here. Its not so much a learning curve as it is a sheer learning cliff. The losses don't teach you anything. At the start of each run you have to choose between 3 randomized heroes and sometimes they all just kinda suck balls. I really hate this system. Preset starting characters like Slay the Spire would be so much better. Also, If this hero dies at any point during the run, you lose. It just doesn't give me that one more run feeling like other games in the genre. Probably because it ends feeling more like a puzzle game than a deckbuilder. You spend way more time analyzing the battle-field trying to make sure your hero isn't going to get one shot than you do actually making plays. One tiny mistake and you lose. You better not make anything less than the absolute optimal choice in every situation or you won't have a chance.","0.528615832328796387","1681362588","false","98","98","0","18","324","10","0","0"

A lot of the mechanics of the game which would be helpful to the player aren't communicated very well, some things that come to mind and I think should be improved:
- Make it apparent who will attack in which order so we can better understand the game mechanics
- Make it clear the attack area on hovering over an enemy (for example until I learnt the hard way I did not know that enemies who take up 2 lanes attack in both lanes at once and this wasn't mentioned in tutorial)
- Make it clear the available options that you could get from the card pool or the trinket pool, if we don't know what we can get in the base game, it's quite difficult to make decisions and the decisions feel a little arbitrary
- If you clear all enemies on the battlefield before the next wave the next wave comes early (this should be communicated)
- You cannot exit the shop after clicking on it (the screen with the snail) you have to go into it, this can be annoying if you accidentally reenter the shop

Some other things that I think would make this a rich experience which seem to not be present:
- Ways to weight certain types of build likelihoods in your run (choose to see more frequent poison cards etc.)
- The prevalence of aimless needs to be reduced in enemies, it does not make it fun to try and strategise, and largely feels uncontrolled and unfair
- give ways to modify the game, eg. more healing items, lower/higher countdown timers on enemies, all enemies enter with a snowed, always start with a random trinket etc. etc. I feel like this would really free up people from the feeling that the game is suffocating and difficult as everyone would be able to set their own modifiers to play the game how they want it, this would also open up potential for more diverse challenge runs which do not need to be part of the daily challenge
- allow us to reroll the starting characters, or make it so there is almost certainly a way in each starting character could be viable, at the moment it seems like some starting characters are just objectively worse, and being forced to play with a mechanic you don't want to play can be very frustrating

To the other players who are frustrated with the game:
While I do agree this game needs a rebalance, I think comparing this to FTL is a better comparison than to slay the spire, in FTL you frequently have bad runs, and there are only a handful of viable builds, this seems to be the approach the developers tried to take with this game. The main thing that I think most people are actually complaining about is that the casual fun looking art style doesn't accurately set you up for the expectation of a difficult FTL-like experience. I do think that this game has amazing potential, just needs some attention to allow for a more customisable and fair experience for players. 
Even without this, I would still recommend this experience to anyone who likes the appeal of the art style, however just know, this game is really quite hard and you have to be okay with failing most of your runs and embrace the roguelike experience.

As many other reviews point out the balance is awful. I have beat the final boss once and that one time I had pseudo infinite set up. And one of the cards I needed to do this I haven't seen as an offer since that run. Most other times I don't even think I made past the first boss.

There are definitely some fun sounding builds but most of the time you don't get offered things that fit into the same play style. On top of that you don't get many rewards before the first boss and since at that point you don't have a good playable strategy you just outright lose. I also feel like a lot of the cards or companions that fit these fun sounding builds are rare so most of the time you find the mediocre to bad (unless they fit your build which you don't have at this time) cards. You can definitely try making a build off of that card but good luck finding all the other cards you need.

I, as many people, could go on and on but I think this [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199192044757/recommended/1811990/]review[/url] already does a great job at explaining more than what I did here so I'm not going to go on.

People seem to dislike the difficulty but I think it's in a good spot. Unlike other deckbuilders your main heros hp does not carry over between battles, this means that fights rarely whittle your resources slightly so that you would die three fights from now at the boss. Instead there are less individual fights in a run, but you will regularly go from full strength to dead in a single fight. One or two misplays can kill you if you're not paying attention because every fight needs to be potentially lethal by design. Personally I like it, as beating the fights while killing all the 'treasure goblins' is fun in the early game. While beating the back half requires good deck construction and execution. 

The things that set this apart from other games I've played is the style polish and charm. The bells jingle, the characters move when you drag the cards around. The shopkeeps and town are adorable.  The art is very cohesive and gives the world a sense of whimsy. It puts a smile on my face every time I meet a new npc. Also the game is just fun. 

Many other deckbuilders start of incredibly slow and easy for me, and only become interesting once you unlock the middle difficulty settings. This one starts slightly higher on the difficulty but has been entertaining the entire time.","0","1681354273","true","704","4071","0","28","0","0","0","0"

It is taking the best of Slay the Spire but also from Rogue Legacy with our village to build up bringing further cards to build up your deck. However the main issue and I’ve seen other sharing this concern is the game is yet to be well balanced. Any deck building game you’re playing will make a you a hard time the first rounds but once you understand the enemies and your deck then you should never lose the first fights. But here you can because it will depends on what you get when you start. And because you got only one support for the first battle you can get overwhelmed very easily. I went through the third world (two boss fight won) and then I play again and loose again the first battle. So definitely some work to do but the ground is solid and this will be a must have once the balance has been fixed. Or maybe it will never be as this is something that can happen in Rogue Legacy too.

There are several ways to scale and keep up with the difficult enemies this game throws at you, and swapping the places of your units on the field every turn to prevent the most damage is not only necessary, but adds another layer of strategy to the game.

There is also an amazing twist once you beat the final boss the first time, but I wont spoil that here.

In it's current state, it's extremely punishing. Other reviews have called it unbalanced, which I disagree with. There is possibly a little too much RNG and/or lack of player agency with your starting decks, but if you can push through the first two fights, you can generally pull something together. I think it's a fair opinion that with these games, you can't expect to win every run. There are always mechanics that will take out your deck, and it can feel bad. That said, it would be great to see the devs implement an ability to 'look forward' like you can in Monster Train, so you can prepare for the fights ahead, or allow you to alter your starting deck like in Across the Obelisk. 

I think this is a buy, even in it's current tricky state, it's fun, cute, and has a very strong foundation.","0.528985500335693359","1681350239","true","343","1637","0","16","565","1","0","0"

If anything this game pays homage to Slay the Spire but also establishes it's own rules and it's own style, and oh what a delightful style it is! 

The art style, music, and overall vibe of the game just can't be beat in the genre. It feels absolutely delightful to play, from sfx, to animations, to the art of every card. A win across the board. 

A lot of negative reviews mention the game being difficult, and I agree with a big asterisk. The game CAN be very difficult, but it's far from unplayable. If anything, it just needs some balance tweaks. Things like enemy number on some fights, certain effect damage, etc. But all of this should be stuff that can be patched. I have no doubt that most of the gripes people have will be fixed ASAP as the devs get more feedback. This game is more than worth your time and attention.

The gameplay (as mentioned by many negative reviews) is quite difficult, which should be seen as a good thing. Characters harmonize well with Items and Charms and many different routes can be taken when building a good team. Yes, the game is punishing and small mistakes may cost you the run. But most of the time when you lose a run, it's because of a mistake you made and not because the game is 'unfair' or 'too RNG heavy'. Every time I lost I knew what went wrong and I wanted to go next, and this is the beauty of a Roguelike.

If you are interested in a difficult card battler with lots of replay value and unlockables you should definitely give it a try and fully ignore negative reviews with 1 hour playtime. If on the other hand you are interested in a card game that takes no brain and makes you feel good about your intelligence: try Uno or Solitaire instead.","0.523809552192687988","1681349056","true","550","4239","0","5","168","2","0","0"

Art on the cards subtly changing depending on circumstances, the little swing of the charm upgrades on cards, ability to rename ANY card on your playthrough, more and more.

Like the best of rogue-likes, you're seeing so much more with each run early in the game. There is a lot of tactical versatility and I can see significant depth in replayability. Daily runs with new experimental builds available from release is nice, too.

It does skew toward the more challenging end of the scale, players new to this style of card game may find themselves losing runs earlier that experienced players, but there are plenty of upgrades and goals to work toward for all levels of players. If you're concerned about the challenge, could be worth doing some online research through youtube first. The game outlines the mechanics but does not give tactical suggestions/tutorials.

In summary, would say it's worth a try. Would at least get plenty of replayability while upgrading your base and discovering new content for at LEAST tens of hours of unique gameplay and discovery.","0","1681348934","true","356","1967","0","1","183","0","0","0"

The major problem with it, and the reason I can't recommend it in its current state is that as others have mentioned; the game is massively overtuned.

I love a good roguelite deckbuilder. I made it a few levels into the ascensions in StS before I decided that they weren't fun for me. I made it to the mid covenants in Monster Train (9 i think?) and maxed every race. Overall I would say I'm a reasonably skilled player in the genre. For this one though, I just can't figure it out. To lay out my issues with the game as of now (Apr 12, 2023):

[list]
    [*] The areas are far too short. You'll be able to add maybe 2 or 3 normal cards to your deck, possibly get a charm or two, and probably add 2 companions before you face off against the first boss. This gives you very little time/opportunity to modify it in a meaningful way and makes it easy for RNG to really wreck a run.
    [*] Even normal monsters are a bit overtuned and far too unforgiving early in the run. A single small mistake on the second enemy can wipe you out
    [*] While I can get past the first area fairly reliably, the second area completely takes me apart. I find the most reliable way to get through the first section is using high health companions with a steady, defensive play style (swapping companions in and out and just dealing consistent damage behind a couple of tanks). The second area punishes you for playing this style. As far as I've seen you can get one of two biomes for your second area; poison or fire (or their equivalents, rather). Poison is simply overpowered against you. If your hero gets hit with a couple stacks of it, you're basically dead since healing is relatively difficult without being able to pull them back into the deck. In the fire area, it seems you need to be able to deal consistently high damage to specific targets. Failing to do so will cause their side to grow out of control. This area also causes a powerful ability (barrage) to become a huge liability.
[/list]

Devs, I really want to love this game. The mechanics are a lot of fun, the visuals are great, and the abilities usually feel really good. But the sheer difficulty and what feels like unfairness in the game just leaves a sour taste in my mouth.","0.590730428695678711","1681348779","false","334","748","0","6","0","233","36","0"

Until you've played enough to completely unlock everything most shouldn't expect to take any run seriously.
Why?
Wildfrost, during it's opening hours, relies heavily on Luck and more-so than any game of this type.

Some will be privileged with fair RnG while others will just be served a poor arrangement of resources and a nasty enemy selection time and time again.

I mean obviously you're going to fail if you have three weak ass characters versus 5 or 6 strong enemies. Attrition: it's simple math!

&

Hence the reviews are currently standing at 'Mixed.'

Choices are peculiar as well with decisions being a leader with 10 HP / 5 ATK VS another with 2 HP, 0 ATK but the ability to wipe a booger of some color on an enemy.

So why the upvote?

The presentation and polish (outside of balance) are superb and the card abilities and combos which you can create with them are smart and engaging.
Also Wildfrost is different enough from others in this genre to feel fresh.

Sadly, however, if the RnG Lord doesn't like you this game won't genuinely begin for a good twenty hours through which you, may as well, just stare at the ceiling while you click, click, click away farming.","0.503759384155273438","1681348199","true","111","242","0","452","0","1","0","0"

Strategize as much as you want, upgrade your cards as much as you can, but your success and your failure relies on the RNG of your hand. And if you try to synergize, the enemies have something to counter with. Bosses that hit every enemy, then gain +1 Attack every time they trigger are brutalizing and even the beginning section is frustratingly difficult.

There is a vast over-reliance on the RNG to behave and play to your deck because otherwise your enemies can just start amping up their damage numbers unimpeded and kill your hero with a random backline enemy with Aimless and 14 damage.

Bullshit. I regret this purchase.","0.444904506206512451","1681328381","false","163","1106","0","17","0","16","3","0"

This game is as hard as slay the spire if not slightly harder, which interesting enough is turning people away. I think the reason people think this game is unfairly hard is because they forgot their first experience with slay the spire or really any deck builder.

Game is incredibly well balanced and every card so far (minus a few) have seem completely viable. Deck building is incredibly important. Most of the negative reviews that complain about balance and difficulty I think don't understand the games mechanic, because the game does have unique systems such as adding cards back to the deck, no mana and turn cooldown instead, and a charm system similar to upgrades from monster train, except they are much more diverse than just pure stat upgrades.

Having finished my first run, the game does have ascension difficulties, so I'm looking forward to see what crazy things I got to deal with.

All in all, if you've been wanting a fresh game with high difficulty, pick this up. If you are hoping for a more simplistic game, this one is not for you.","0.546949028968811035","1681342754","true","356","2602","0","68","0","7","0","0"

It's definitely a challenge, partially cause it does different things with the roguelike deckbuilder formula. Recalling units, managing when you redraw, etc. But I found that if I approach failed runs with the roguelike mentality of learning the systems, learning what your weaknesses were that run, etc, then it didn't bother me. 

I think my main criticism right now is that I'd love to see some improved clarity of how the turn is going to play out. There were times I was like, 'Oh, I'm fine. Have this in the bag,' and I just missed somehow that the attack was sooner or bigger than I thought.

A roguelike deckbuilder that is both cute and cruel.
Truly clever, and terrifyingly EVIL.
Heaps of fun and heartbreaking.

Every decision you make from the first boss onwards is life or death as your foes drastically rocket up in terms of power, and you must match it with ever more cleverness and strategy...

It's brutally hard, and runs can go from smooth sailing to instant death in one single miscalculation... But with each run being short and snappy, and every impact feeling chunky and deliberate, the journey is worth the challenge.

Having just cleared a run, and still being at the start of the unlock process...Genuinely, I think they've crafted one of the Great Games of this genre.  Something that may actually dethrone Slay The Spire as the current king.

What I like in the nature of roguelike-deckbuilders is the joy of discovering combinations of cards that are super powerful, even if a little unbalanced! A lot of the 'not recommended' reviews are complaining about balance, but to me that's not as critical of an issue as updates can always fix major problems if need be.

People say that that this game is hard.  They are correct.  

It has a cute exterior but it's not some phone game where you can turn your brain off, toss down cards, and expect to win.  But every tribe is viable, and every card and charm has at least a niche where it can shine (yes, even the weakness charm).

The art style is superb and wholesome, got me immersed quickly. 
The different card synergies you build can be very powerful if played right, however you will still get clapped regardless. 
I've only put about 2.5 hours into the game as of this review, however, I am going to be putting a lot more because despite the many times I've failed it still feels somewhat rewarding. 
Ignore the negative reviews, they were written by people who can't handle some Ass whopping. 

I rarely ever write reviews but seeing the mixed reviews made me want to give this game a thumbs up because it deserves it.

Finally a game that elevates rogue-like deck-builders to the next level. Mechanics feel fresh, the art, music, sound, animations are all gorgeous. There's so much depth at every turn.

Slay the Spire broke new ground for the genre by adding tons of variety and making battles more 'solveable' instead of being so reliant on RNG. Wildfrost gives even more freedom and flexibilty while building upon and adding twists to many of the common tropes of the genre. There are a lot of layers here with which to make significant choices in during gameplay, but it all feels cohesive and manageable.

Also there's unlockables (like Slay the Spire, but far more) but not meta progession (like Hades). This creates a much more satisfying experience over time as you improve your skills and learn the systems and enemies.

I'm sure a lot of other reviewers will complain about the difficulty, but the reality is that most of the other deck building games are completely broken and far too easy to win with.
If you're the kind of player that was disappointed with how easy to break slay the spire and monster train were, you'll enjoy the challenge this game offers a lot more, and will get much more mileage from it instead of completely rolling the dungeon in very little playtime.

You'll have to gain knowledge and skill through your runs and sharpen your planning and decision making a lot more than in similar titles. It feels fresh, incredibly well thought out, and highly replayable.

You can clearly tell a lot of thought went into balancing and laying out how you progress through your runs.

As a fan of both rogue-like games and deck builders, this game hits all the right notes for me. The unique blend of strategic deck building and tactical combat makes for an incredibly engaging and immersive experience.

The art style is absolutely gorgeous, and the attention to detail in the game world is stunning. I love exploring and discovering all the hidden secrets that Wildfrost has to offer.

But what really sets Wildfrost apart for me is the way it manages to strike a perfect balance between challenge and reward. Every victory feels hard-earned, but also incredibly satisfying. And even when I lose, I feel like I've learned something valuable that I can use to improve my strategy next time.

Overall, I can't recommend Wildfrost enough. It's an absolute must-play for fans of rogue-like games and deck builders.","0.498301237821578979","1681324050","true","96","96","0","1","0","0","0","0"

I thoroughly enjoyed my time with the demo (around 10 hours on the switch) which ultimately left me with high expectations for the full release. I’ve played 2 games runs with one resulting in a win and have thoroughly enjoyed myself. 

The game definitely plays different than more traditional deck builders and takes a bit of time to understand and operate within the problem space it creates. The strategy of WildFrost is a combination of deck building and unit positioning, which I’ve had a blast with. 

Being that card additions are less frequent than something like Slay the Spire, individual cards play a much larger role in your deck. In that same breath, you tend to rely more on synergies between 2-3 cards as opposed to total deck synergy. The deck size in this game is fairly small, so even though synergies tend to be smaller in scale, my experience has been that I’m able to capitalize on these smaller synergies multiple times throughout the course of a battle. 

It’s definitely not for everyone, but I think it’s disingenuous label it as an unbalanced mess.","0","1681323932","true","65","2825","0","6","0","1","0","0"

If you enjoy games like Slay the Spire and Monster Train you will probably enjoy this as well.

I rarely play Roguelikes, and Card Battlers even less so. The gameplay has always seemed interesting, but their artstyles trend towards grimy and grisly. A step outside the aesthetic for games I usually appreciate. So when I saw Wildfrost addressed my biggest concern with those other card battlers I was immediately eager to give it a try.

Battles are deceptively complex. The game is split in 3x2 rows. Twice over for ally and enemy sides. Every Companion card and enemy has a Counter at the bottom that determines how many turns until they act. Using effects like Snowball to manipulate enemy turns is one point of complexity. But you're also able to re-arrange units freely. Choosing who to take damage and win is another point of complexity. These two systems together make for a robust and engaging strategy that has had me equally groaning in frustration as I forgot to move an ally to safety and feeling like the smartest person on earth when I manipulate the rows and enemy turns just right to eek out a victory. Seeing is believing though, so I strongly encourage you find a streamer play the game to get a grasp of what the game is like. 

Enemies appear in waves and typically have synergistic bonuses that will challenge players. This is good, as it ensures you need to have an answer to everything. For example, I ran in with a bunch of units focused around multi-attacking. They didn't have very strong attack power, but their multiple attacks would add up to a higher value than most unit's one big attack. This was going fine until I encountered a group of enemies who carried a buff that reflects fixed damage every time they're hit. Had I only been relying on these multi-strike units that would have been the end of me. But I also had a number of block and attack up cards. By skillfully rotating my units, applying shields, and buffing their attacks I was able to push through. This wound up being the hardest encounter of my run since they countered my build, but by ensuring I had a diversity of options and just a bit of wit the challenge was surmountable. Enemies behave predictably (most of the time, Aimless can be a hard keyword to work around), and I was able to score my first win in only two runs. Recall what I said at the start, I am not very familiar with roguelikes nor card battlers. I include this because I've seen a few reviews complain that the game is too hard, but personally as someone unfamiliar with the genre I found the difficulty just right. Challenging enough that I had to pay attention and think laterally, but not so challenging as to be frustrating or 'impossible'.

But for those of you who think that it might be too easy, fear not. After your first win the game will begin offering challenge modifiers. These are my favorite kind of challenge modifiers, the ones that add complexity to the game in exchange for bigger rewards. The first one adds powerful bonus effects to some enemies while rewarding me more gold to bring them down. What was once a meager trio of penguins attacking thrice for 1 damage, are now sporting 3 damage three times. In a game where the average Hero unit only has 9 HP, that's frighteningly powerful. But in exchange for handling that threat I get more gold. More gold means I can afford better options at the shop, and thus I can make more decisive plays. It's an excellent example of risk vs reward.

I normally wouldn't include spoilers, but the best game mechanic deserves special mention. Once clearing your first run [spoiler] your old party is possessed and takes over as the final boss. Complete with menacing glowy eyes and a nice evil supercharge to their abilities. That incredibly well-rounded team I mentioned before has now become an incredibly well-rounded supercharged final boss. And she's stronger than when I went in. This delightfully insidious mechanic forces the player to consistently improve in order to defeat their old winning strategies. It won't be enough to simply try to outscale the bosses, you'll need a different strategy. The boss I created is powerful, but I'm sure I can come up with a counter.[/spoiler]

Thankfully as you play you get more cards, more Tribes (who each have unique sets of cards available to them), and more options. This means more chances for powerful synergies, and thus more complex decks. If I had to list one complaint, it's that the difficulty of Area 2 is more difficult than Area 3. Perhaps this is intentional, to allow the player to finish their decks in comfort before facing a powerful final boss, but the difficulty curve feels like a hill more than a ramp. If I were to change this, I would simply swap the area 2 and 3 enemies. Or perhaps buff the Area 3 enemies to be even more difficult than Area 2. Or perhaps those charms and other difficulty modifiers will eventually make those enemies scale harder than the ones in area 2. 

In summary I am having a great time with the game. There's a few hiccups here and there but I'm reasonably confident the devs will work hard on fixing those, so I've opted to not include them in my review for now. I look forward to seeing this game's continued success and I hope more people give it a try.","0","1681323409","true","211","1150","0","3","0","0","0","0"

Graphics and sound are great, however the balance is the worst I've seen in a game of this kind. It feels like almost every run is completely unwinnable regardless of build or strategy. 

At first look it seems a refreshing idea with how the turn system works, but it turns out to be a horrible mess in practice with you often being outnumbered and underpowered compared to your opponents, there is no gentle rise in difficulty and due to this, you feel as though you don't even have a chance to build a decent deck before even your first boss fight.

I doubt the devs will be able to salvage this game without serious reworks, if you are considering buying, DON'T, unless they have made serious changes since this review.","0.408709198236465454","1681320552","false","312","396","0","7","0","7","3","6"

If you liked Into the Breach, you'll love this. The game is difficult, but nothing here is 'gimmicky', as I saw in another review - Wildfrost has a huge web of simple game mechanics (such as keywords and status effects), that all intertwine, and always interact with each other exactly like you'd expect - sometimes to surprising and delightful results, a la Spelunky. All of the mechanics that make the game difficult, are also made available to you, the player, to use to your advantage. As such, Wildfrost greatly, and frequently, rewards your creativity.

This is also helped by the outstanding art and sound design. You can see how cute the art is from the trailers, but I was also delightfully surprised by the SFX and VFX. Every action and status effect in the game gives satisfying feedback, both visually and audibly. Without exaggeration, Wildfrost might have the best indie gamefeel since Nuclear Throne.

I have only sunk a few hours into the game at the time of writing, but it also seems heavily replayable - which is important for a roguelike. I can see myself sinking hundreds of hours into this - much like I have with the other roguelike games mentioned in this review. And I guess that's the bottom line: this game is simply among the all-time greats of the roguelike genre. I don't know why the reviews are so mixed right now, but I really hope it doesn't fly under the radar. If you enjoyed any of the other games I mentioned in this review (or Slay the Spire), you'd be doing yourself a disservice not to pick up Wildfrost.","0.652334451675415039","1681319719","true","249","16471","622","7","0","27","0","0"

There's no prediction/preview of what will happen next turn like there is in Monster Train. Given that your hero usually has single digit HP values, if you miss anything you can die in an instant and lose the whole run, which is frustrating.

Combat (where you'll be spending most of your time) is fun and engaging, and requires a good amount of strategising to avoid your units being hurt while still damaging the enemies. Battles are tense, especially against bosses, and overcoming them feels great. Do be advised though that some combats can be [i] really [/i] difficult the first time round (and even subsequent times in some cases) so make sure you're prepared to lose runs.
The card upgrade system - Charms - is really unlike anything I've seen before, but it makes so much sense that I'm wondering why no one else has tried it yet. Rather than preset or predetermined upgrades, you can place Charms on cards to enhance or change their effects in various ways. This allows for many different combos and strategies to be formed from the same set of cards.
Wildfrost has meta-progression, albeit fairly simple. As you complete quests (through several runs), you can unlock a few new Items, Companions, and Pets to help you on your journey.
You can also unlock the (as of writing) two non-starter Tribes, who have unique cards and mechanics at their disposal. I won't spoil what features they have access to here, but it's safe to say that each Tribe really promotes a unique playstyle and provides great new deckbuilding opportunities.
Overall, Wildfrost provides a good roguelike experience that I haven't really found in any other game. Definitely pick it up if you're a fan of the genre.","0.519230782985687256","1681319588","true","232","3196","0","9","106","2","0","0"

I have mixed feelings about this mechanic as it seems to punish good team builds, but it also makes it constantly challenging as you will continue to get better teams to beat the previous team.

I'm really not know all about Deck building game so I can't pointing out on if this is a good game for that genre or not. But I can given you a detail on what you'll get on this game.

- Deck building game: Everything is card, Including you and you companions.
- On your journey you can pick a cards  to assisting in your journey, So don't worry, You'll have a lot of cards.
- Which also mean you have to building your own deck. The card consisted of Weapons, Companions and Equipments. Playing each card will subtracting a turn on both you and the enemies. Any card hit zero first get to hit first.
- So its basically a game of wits where you'll have to manage the card you'll play before your team gets to hit  the enemies turn by turn. And trust me, Its not that easy at all. and you are going to losing alot.......This is where Rouge lite elements come into play.

1. At the beginning of each match, You'll get to pick 1 out of 3 randomize heroes.  Each will have different hit point and Health point. Also some of them will come pack with the effect such as Barrage (Hit all enemies in the same row) etc. etc.

2. You'l die. ALOT. Which if you are able to complete certain objective on each match. You'll progressively unlocking the building on your starting point. Allow for better equipment, companion and pets (And more)

So basically, This game is best because you can swooshing in and out for a quick rush and just leave when you thing just gone down hill and coming back later for better tryout. Its really fun especially when you just want to have something casual and still feeling serious at same time.

Oh yeah, And the art is cute as hell. Probably a reason why I bought this game.","0.506911635398864746","1681310979","true","13","1154","0","154","0","2","0","0"

But the moment that clicks, it just becomes an incredibly fun puzzle to win the battles.

The runs are fairly short (an hour to two, depending on how long you think about turns), which is a real plus for me - I can play a single run and then hop and do something else for a while.
The progression unlocks different tribes (card sets) and some new cards, but the cards you have in the beginning are completely valid to win a run.
Cards can be upgraded in a run to focus on different builds.
The art style is amazing. The UI is great, it runs smooth and the music is incredibly cool.

And if you're 1 coin short in the shop and click an item repeatedly, the shop keeper takes pity on you and sells it regardless. Whats not to love?
Give it a try. It's a great game.","0.703028380870819092","1681302928","true","165","2053","0","38","0","64","0","0"

nowdays is a rare sight to buy a finished game at launch day, tho i still hope more content will be added.

I love everything about this game ever since the demo, the charming as heck artstyle, the music, the depth of all play with your allies, clunker, charms, etc., that adds to the synergy.

Two of my favorite deckbuilders are Slay the Spire and Vault of the Void, and I have a good feeling that Wildfrost will end up close to those two. If you love roguelite deckbuilders, this game is a no brainer.","0","1681297354","true","59","919","0","11","0","0","0","0"

I'm hooked on deckbuilding roguelikes ever since StP and this is one of the best I've ever played.
The artstyle and the animations are gorgeous, the spins and turns on the ageing deckbuilding genre are refreshing and I can really recommend this game to anyone who has ever played a deckbuilding game and thought 'well, this is fun!'

10/10 definitely my indie game of the year so far.","0","1681296755","true","15","646","0","27","0","0","0","0"

The game is tough and your deck needs to have solutions for every situation, deckbuilding is much more complicated than just filling your deck up with matching keywords/synergies and winning the run on sheer power. It's worth noting that all of the battles in each run are interesting rather than the 'filler' battles which many similar games feature.

Finally the theme/artwork are top notch and there is plenty of content to unlock to give the game some longevity!
